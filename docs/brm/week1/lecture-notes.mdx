## **Week 1: Introduction to Research**

### **1. What is Business Research?**

**Business Research** is a systematic and objective process of gathering, recording, and analyzing data for aid in making business decisions. It's not about just "googling" something; it's a formal inquiry. Think of it as the organizational equivalent of a detective's investigation.

**Why is it important?**
* **Reduces Uncertainty:** Business is full of risks. Research provides data to turn "gut feelings" into evidence-based decisions.
* **Identifies Opportunities & Threats:** Helps a company spot a new market trend (opportunity) or understand why a competitor is gaining market share (threat).
* **Solves Problems:** Provides a structured way to diagnose and solve specific problems, like declining sales, low employee morale, or inefficient production.
* **Improves Strategy:** From marketing campaigns to product development, research underpins effective planning.

### **2. The Role of Theory in Research**

A **theory** is a formal, logical explanation of some events that includes predictions of how things relate to one another. In research, a theory acts as a map. It suggests which variables are important and how they might be connected.

For example:
* **Theory:** *Employee Motivation Theory* suggests that higher job satisfaction (a concept) leads to higher job performance (another concept).
* **Research:** We can use this theory to form a specific, testable prediction: "Employees at our company who report higher satisfaction scores will have higher annual performance ratings."

### **3. The Research Process**

The research process is a series of logical and sequential steps. While it can sometimes be iterative, it generally follows this path:

1.  **Identify the Problem/Opportunity:** Defining precisely what you want to investigate. A well-defined problem is half solved!
2.  **Review Existing Literature:** What is already known about this topic? This step prevents you from "reinventing the wheel" and helps refine your research question.
3.  **Formulate Research Questions & Hypotheses:** A **research question** is what you want to find out. A **hypothesis** ($H_1$) is a specific, testable prediction about the relationship between variables (e.g., "Increased TV advertising will lead to increased sales").
4.  **Design the Research:** This is the master plan. It specifies the methods and procedures for collecting and analyzing the needed information. Key decisions here involve which approach to use.
5.  **Collect the Data:** Executing the research design. This could involve surveys, interviews, experiments, or observations.
6.  **Analyze the Data:** Turning raw data into meaningful information. This is where tools like SPSS become crucial.
7.  **Report Findings & Make Recommendations:** Communicating the results and their implications to stakeholders, often in the form of a report or presentation.

### **4. Key Research Approaches**

#### **a) Quantitative vs. Qualitative Research**

| Feature | **Quantitative Research** | **Qualitative Research** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To test hypotheses, look at cause & effect, and make predictions. | To explore ideas, understand experiences, and formulate theories. |
| **Data Type** | Numerical data, statistics üìä. | Non-numerical data like text, video, photos, and audio recordings üìù. |
| **Questions** | How many? How much? | Why? How? In what way? |
| **Sample Size** | Large, to be generalizable. | Small, for in-depth understanding. |
| **Example**| A survey of 500 customers rating their satisfaction on a scale of 1-10. | A series of in-depth interviews with 10 customers to understand their feelings about a new product. |

#### **b) Deductive vs. Inductive Reasoning**

* **Deductive (Top-Down):** Starts with a **theory**, develops a **hypothesis**, and then collects **data** to test that theory. This is most common in quantitative research.
  * *Theory ‚Üí Hypothesis ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Confirmation*
* **Inductive (Bottom-Up):** Starts with specific **observations**, looks for **patterns**, and develops a general **theory** or conclusion from the data. This is most common in qualitative research.
  * *Observation ‚Üí Pattern ‚Üí Tentative Hypothesis ‚Üí Theory*
