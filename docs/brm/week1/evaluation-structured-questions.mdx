**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Differentiate between **Quantitative** and **Qualitative** research approaches. In your answer, you must describe the primary purpose of each and the type of data they typically generate.
[10]

    **Answer:**

    **Quantitative Research** is an approach used to quantify a problem by generating numerical data or data that can be transformed into usable statistics. Its primary purpose is to test specific hypotheses, examine cause-and-effect relationships, and make predictions or generalize findings to a larger population. The data generated is always **numerical**, such as survey ratings, frequencies, percentages, and measurements.

    **Qualitative Research** is an exploratory approach used to gain an in-depth understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. Its primary purpose is to explore ideas, understand experiences, and formulate theories. The data generated is **non-numerical (categorical)**, such as interview transcripts, open-ended survey responses, field notes, and video or audio recordings.

    **Marking Scheme:**
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly states the purpose of Quantitative research (testing hypotheses, prediction).
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly identifies the data type for Quantitative research (numerical).
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly states the purpose of Qualitative research (exploring ideas, understanding experiences).
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly identifies the data type for Qualitative research (non-numerical).
    * [2 Marks] - For a clear and direct comparison highlighting the core differences.

(b) The **Research Process** consists of several logical stages. Outline five key stages of this process, from the initial step to the final one, and briefly explain the main activity in each stage.

    **Answer:**

    The five key stages of the research process are:

    1. **Identify the Problem/Opportunity:** This initial stage involves defining the research problem or question with precision. It is the foundation of the entire study, where the researcher clarifies exactly what they need to investigate.
    2. **Review Existing Literature:** In this stage, the researcher conducts a thorough review of existing academic and professional publications to understand what is already known about the topic. This prevents duplication and helps to refine the research question.
    3. **Design the Research:** This is the planning stage where the researcher creates a master plan (the methodology). It involves deciding on the research approach (e.g., survey, experiment), sampling methods, and data collection procedures.
    4. **Analyze the Data:** After data has been collected, this stage involves organizing, cleaning, and analyzing the data using appropriate statistical or qualitative techniques to identify patterns, relationships, and insights.
    5. **Report Findings & Make Recommendations:** The final stage involves interpreting the results of the analysis and communicating the findings to relevant stakeholders through a formal report or presentation. This stage translates the data into actionable insights.

    **Marking Scheme:**
    * [2 Marks] - For each correctly identified and explained stage (Total of 10 marks). Award 1 mark for naming the stage and 1 mark for a clear explanation.

(c) Explain the relationship between a **theory** and a **hypothesis** in deductive research.
[5]

    **Answer:**

    In deductive research, the relationship is hierarchical and flows from general to specific. A **theory** is a broad, well-established explanation for a phenomenon (e.g., *Motivation Theory suggests that recognition increases job satisfaction*). A **hypothesis** is a specific, testable, and falsifiable prediction derived from that theory (e.g., *"If we implement an 'Employee of the Month' program, then our company's average job satisfaction score will increase by 10% within six months"*).

    Essentially, the theory provides the map, and the hypothesis is the specific route you test to see if the map is accurate in a particular context.

    **Marking Scheme:**
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly defines theory as a broad explanation.
    * [2 Marks] - Correctly defines hypothesis as a specific, testable prediction derived from theory.
    * [1 Mark] - Clearly explains the "general to specific" relationship.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A retail company wants to understand why a newly launched product is not selling well. The management team is debating whether to start their investigation with a deductive or an inductive research approach.

Compare and contrast **Deductive** and **Inductive** reasoning in a research context, and advise the management team on which approach would be more suitable to start with and why.
[10]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    **Comparison:**
    * **Deductive Reasoning (Top-Down):** Starts with a general theory or hypothesis and works towards specific observations to confirm or reject it. It is typically used in quantitative research to test pre-existing ideas. (e.g., *Theory: Price is the main factor. Hypothesis: If we lower the price, sales will increase. Action: Test this hypothesis.*)
    * **Inductive Reasoning (Bottom-Up):** Starts with specific observations and data, seeks out patterns, and develops a general theory or conclusion from them. It is typically used in qualitative research to explore a problem and generate new theories when little is known. (e.g., *Action: Interview customers about the product. Observation: Many say the packaging is confusing. Theory: Poor packaging design is hurting sales.*)

    **Advice to Management:**
    They should start with an **inductive approach**. Because they are unsure *why* the product is failing, they lack a solid theory to test. An inductive approach (e.g., through focus groups or in-depth interviews with customers) would allow them to explore all potential reasons—price, packaging, quality, marketing, etc.—and build a theory from the ground up based on real customer feedback. Starting with a deductive approach would be a guess (e.g., assuming it's a price problem) which might waste time and resources if incorrect.

    **Marking Scheme:**
    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of Deductive reasoning.
    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of Inductive reasoning.
    * [2 Marks] - For correctly advising an inductive approach.
    * [2 Marks] - For a strong justification explaining *why* an inductive approach is better for this exploratory problem.

(b) A university wants to improve its library services for students. They hire you as a research consultant. To address their goal, formulate one **qualitative** research question and one **quantitative** research question that you could investigate. Justify why each question fits its respective research approach.
[15]

<details>

    **Answer:**

    **Qualitative Research Question:**
    * **Question:** "What are the lived experiences and perceptions of postgraduate students when using the university library's digital resources for their research?"
    * **Justification:** This question is qualitative because it seeks to gain a deep, in-depth understanding of experiences and perceptions. It explores the "why" and "how" of student behaviour. The data collected would be non-numerical, likely from in-depth interviews or focus groups, generating rich, descriptive text for analysis.

    **Quantitative Research Question:**
    * **Question:** "Is there a statistically significant correlation between the number of hours students spend in the library per week and their overall Grade Point Average (GPA)?"
    * **Justification:** This question is quantitative because it seeks to measure the relationship between two specific, numerical variables (hours spent, and GPA). It requires collecting numerical data from a larger sample of students to perform statistical analysis (like a correlation test) to identify a quantifiable pattern.

    **Marking Scheme:**
    * [4 Marks] - For a well-formulated qualitative question that is exploratory and open-ended.
    * [3 Marks] - For a clear justification explaining why the question is qualitative (e.g., seeks understanding, non-numerical data).
    * [4 Marks] - For a well-formulated quantitative question that is specific, measurable, and seeks to test a relationship.
    * [4 Marks] - For a clear justification explaining why the question is quantitative (e.g., uses numerical variables, requires statistical analysis).
