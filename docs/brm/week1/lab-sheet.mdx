### **Lab 1: Getting Started with SPSS**

**Objective:**
To become familiar with the basic interface of IBM SPSS Statistics, understand the difference between the 'Data View' and 'Variable View' windows, and practice entering a simple dataset.

**Software:**
IBM SPSS Statistics

### **Part A: Exploring the SPSS Environment**

1.  **Launch SPSS.** When it opens, you will likely see a welcome dialog box. You can close this for now.
2.  The main window you see is the **Data Editor**. This window has two tabs at the bottom-left corner:
* **Data View:** This looks like a spreadsheet. It's where you will enter your raw data. Each row represents a **case** (e.g., a person, a company), and each column represents a **variable** (e.g., age, gender, sales).
* **Variable View:** This is the "dictionary" for your data. It's where you define the properties of each variable (column). Each row here represents a variable.

### **Part B: Entering a Simple Dataset**

Let's enter the following data from a small survey of 5 participants:

| Participant ID | Age | Gender | Satisfaction (1-5) |
| :--- | :-: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 21 | Female | 4 |
| 2 | 34 | Male | 5 |
| 3 | 25 | Male | 3 |
| 4 | 42 | Male | 5 |
| 5 | 29 | Female | 4 |

**Instructions:**

1.  **Go to the `Variable View` tab.** We will define our variables first.
2.  In the first row, under the **Name** column, type `Participant_ID`.
3.  In the second row, type `Age`.
4.  In the third row, type `Gender`.
5.  In the fourth row, type `Satisfaction`.
6.  Now, let's define the `Gender` variable more clearly. Find the row for `Gender` and click on the cell in the **Values** column. A small button with three dots `...` will appear. Click it.
* In the 'Value Labels' dialog box, enter `1` in the **Value** box and `Male` in the **Label** box. Click **Add**.
* Next, enter `2` in the **Value** box and `Female` in the **Label** box. Click **Add**.
* Click **OK**. This tells SPSS that whenever we type `1` for Gender, it means 'Male', and `2` means 'Female'.
7.  **Click on the `Data View` tab** at the bottom-left. You will now see your variable names as column headers.
8.  Enter the data from the table above. For the `Gender` column, you can enter the numbers (1 for Male, 2 for Female).

*Your Data View should look like this:*

| Participant\_ID | Age | Gender | Satisfaction |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 21 | 2 | 4 |
| 2 | 34 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 25 | 1 | 3 |
| 4 | 42 | 1 | 5 |
| 5 | 29 | 2 | 4 |

9.  **Save your work.** Go to **File -> Save As...** and save the file as `Week1_Lab.sav`. The `.sav` extension is the standard for SPSS data files.
