    **Answer:**

    The primary purpose of a **Literature Review** is to provide a critical synthesis of existing academic knowledge on a topic. It is not just a summary of other studies.

    It must accomplish three key things:

    1. **Demonstrate Knowledge:** Show that the researcher is familiar with important, existing work in the field.
    2. **Situate the Research:** Place the proposed study within the context of the ongoing academic conversation, showing how it relates to previous work.
    3. **Justify the Research:** Identify a **gap** in the current literature — a question not answered, a controversy needing resolution, or a finding needing testing in a new context.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[4 Marks] – Clear statement of the primary purpose (synthesis of existing knowledge).
    * \[2 Marks each] – For each of the three key accomplishments correctly identified and explained (Total 6 marks).

## **QUESTION 3 \[25 MARKS]**

A company wants to test if employee training hours are associated with job satisfaction scores (measured on a 1–10 scale).
They survey 120 employees, recording each employee’s **total training hours** in the past year and **job satisfaction score**.

---

**(a)** Which statistical test should the researcher use to examine the relationship between these two variables?
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    The correct test is the **Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient** (Pearson’s r), as both variables are continuous.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – Correct identification of Pearson’s r.

</details>

---

**(b)** The correlation coefficient is found to be **r = 0.68** with **p = 0.002**. Interpret these results in the context of the study.
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    There is a **strong, positive, and statistically significant** relationship between training hours and job satisfaction. Employees with more training hours tend to report higher job satisfaction.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – Correct interpretation of strength and direction.
    * \[3 Marks] – Correct interpretation of statistical significance using p-value.

</details>

---

**(c)** Explain why correlation does not imply causation in this context.
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    Even though the variables are related, we cannot conclude that increasing training hours directly causes higher job satisfaction. Other factors (e.g., management style, pay, work culture) could be influencing both variables.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – Correctly state that correlation ≠ causation.
    * \[3 Marks] – Provide plausible explanation of other influencing variables.

</details>

---

**(d)** Suggest one statistical method the researcher could use if they wanted to **predict** job satisfaction scores from training hours.
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    The researcher could use **Simple Linear Regression**, with training hours as the independent variable and job satisfaction score as the dependent variable.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – Correctly name Simple Linear Regression.

</details>

---

**(e)** Name two assumptions that must be met for the statistical test in part (a).
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    1. **Linearity** – The relationship between training hours and job satisfaction should be linear.
    2. **Normality** – Both variables should be approximately normally distributed.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – Correct identification of assumption 1.
    * \[3 Marks] – Correct identification of assumption 2.

## **QUESTION 4 \[25 MARKS]**

A researcher runs a simple linear regression to see if **Years of Job Experience** can predict an employee's **Job Performance Score** (out of 100).
They get the following output:

**(a)** Interpret the **R-squared** value in the context of this study.
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    The R-squared value of 0.750 means that **75% of the variance** in 'Job Performance Score' can be explained by 'Years of Job Experience'.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – Correct interpretation stating the percentage of variance explained.

</details>

---

**(b)** Write out the full **regression equation** for this model.
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    The regression equation is:
    **Job Performance Score = 30.0 + (5.0 × Years of Experience)**

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – Correctly written equation including both the constant and the slope.

</details>

---

**(c)** Using the equation, what is the **predicted** Job Performance Score for an employee with **8 years of experience**?
\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    Predicted Score = 30.0 + (5.0 × 8)
    Predicted Score = 30.0 + 40.0
    Predicted Score = **70.0**

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – Correct substitution of values into the equation.
    * \[3 Marks] – Correct final answer.

\[5 Marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    Yes, 'Years of Experience' is a statistically significant predictor. The p-value (**Sig. = 0.001**) is less than the standard alpha level of 0.05.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – Correctly state "Yes".
    * \[3 Marks] – Justify using the p-value.
