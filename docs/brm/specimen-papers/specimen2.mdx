    **Answer:**
    A **construct** is a complex, abstract concept that is deliberately invented for a specific research purpose and is not directly observable.

    **Example:** *Brand Equity* is a construct that is built from simpler concepts like brand loyalty, brand awareness, and perceived quality.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[3 Marks] – For a correct definition of a construct (abstract, invented for research).
    * \[2 Marks] – For a suitable business-related example.

**(c)** What is a **sampling frame** and why is it essential for conducting simple random sampling?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    A **sampling frame** is a complete list of every individual or item in the target population from which a sample is drawn (e.g., an employee directory, a list of all registered voters).
    It is essential for simple random sampling because, to give every individual an equal chance of being selected, you must first have a list of all of them.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For a correct definition of a sampling frame.
    * \[3 Marks] – For explaining its importance for random sampling (to give everyone an equal chance).

**(d)** Differentiate between a **True Experimental Design** and a **Quasi-Experimental Design**.
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    Both designs involve the manipulation of an independent variable.
    The key difference is that a **True Experimental Design** uses **random assignment** of participants to treatment and control groups, while a **Quasi-Experimental Design** **lacks random assignment** because it uses pre-existing groups.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For identifying that both involve manipulation.
    * \[3 Marks] – For correctly stating that the key difference is the presence or absence of random assignment.

**(e)** Define **Reliability** in the context of measurement.
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    **Reliability** refers to the **consistency** and **stability** of a measurement tool.
    A reliable measure will produce the same or very similar results if it is used multiple times to measure the same thing under the same conditions.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For a clear definition emphasizing consistency or stability.

## **QUESTION 2 \[Total: 25 Marks]**

**(a)** A manager wants to know if a new "flexible hours" policy will improve employee morale. Formulate a **directional alternative hypothesis (\$H\_1\$)** for this research topic.
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    **Directional Alternative Hypothesis (\$H\_1\$):** Employees who are on the new flexible hours policy will have **higher** mean morale scores than employees who are on the standard hours policy.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For a clear hypothesis that specifies the direction of the expected effect.

</details>

---

**(b)** For the same scenario as part (a), what is the **null hypothesis (\$H\_0\$)**?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    **Null Hypothesis (\$H\_0\$):** There is no significant difference in the mean morale scores between employees on the flexible hours policy and those on the standard hours policy.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For a clear null hypothesis stating no difference or no effect.

</details>

---

**(c)** To quickly gather data, the manager decides to survey the first 50 employees who arrive at the office on a Monday. What specific **sampling method** is this, and what is its main weakness?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    This is **Convenience Sampling**.
    Its main weakness is that the sample is **not likely to be representative** of the entire employee population and is therefore highly prone to selection bias (e.g., early arrivers may have different attitudes than late arrivers).

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For correctly identifying Convenience Sampling.
    * \[3 Marks] – For identifying its main weakness (lack of representativeness/bias).

</details>

---

**(d)** To get richer initial feedback, the manager decides to use a **focus group**. What is one key advantage of a focus group over a simple survey?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    A key advantage is the **group interaction**.
    This allows the researcher to gain deeper insights as participants discuss, debate, and build on each other's ideas, revealing nuances of opinion that would not be captured in individual survey responses.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For identifying a key advantage (e.g., group interaction, deeper insights, exploring the "why").

</details>

---

**(e)** If the manager's survey used a question "How satisfied are you?" with the options `1=Very Dissatisfied` to `5=Very Satisfied`, what **level of measurement** is this?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    This is an **Ordinal** level of measurement, as the categories have a clear rank order, but the intervals between them are not necessarily equal.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For correctly identifying the level as Ordinal.

</details>

## **QUESTION 3 \[Total: 25 Marks]**

**(a)** You have a dataset of employee salaries that includes a few very high-paid executives. Which measure of central tendency (**mean** or **median**) would better represent a "typical" salary, and why?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    The **median** would be a better representation.
    This is because the mean is very sensitive to **outliers** (the high executive salaries), which would pull the average up and make it seem artificially high. The median, as the middle value, is not affected by these extreme values.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For correctly identifying the Median.
    * \[3 Marks] – For explaining that the mean is sensitive to outliers.

**(b)** A company tests two different website designs (A and B) to see which one leads to a higher average time spent on the site. What specific **statistical test** should they use to compare the means?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    They should use an **Independent-Samples t-Test**, as they are comparing the mean of a continuous variable (time spent) between two independent groups (Design A vs. Design B).

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For correctly identifying the Independent-Samples t-Test.

</details>

---

**(c)** For the test in part (b), the p-value is **0.041**. Is this result statistically significant (using α = 0.05)? What does this mean?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    Yes, the result is **statistically significant**.
    This means that because the p-value (0.041) is less than the alpha level (0.05), the researcher can **reject the null hypothesis** and conclude that there is a real difference in the average time spent between the two website designs.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For stating the result is significant.
    * \[3 Marks] – For explaining that the null hypothesis can be rejected.

</details>

**(d)** A researcher measures employee productivity before and after a training program. What specific **statistical test** should they use to compare the means?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    They should use a **Paired-Samples t-Test**, as they are comparing the means of the same group of employees measured at two different times (pre-test/post-test design).

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For correctly identifying the Paired-Samples t-Test.

</details>

**(b)** A researcher wants to predict a student's `final_exam_score` based on their `hours_studied`. What analysis should be used?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    **Simple Linear Regression** should be used, as it models the relationship between two continuous variables for the purpose of prediction.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For correctly identifying Simple Linear Regression.

</details>

---

**(c)** In the analysis from part (b), the **R-squared (\$R^2\$)** is 0.64. What does this value mean?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    An R-squared value of 0.64 means that **64% of the variance** in `final_exam_score` can be explained by the variable `hours_studied`.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For a correct interpretation stating the percentage of variance explained.

</details>

---

**(d)** What is the ethical principle of **Informed Consent**?
\[5 marks]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**
    **Informed Consent** is the ethical principle that requires researchers to fully inform potential participants about the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits of a study before they agree to participate. Participation must be voluntary, and they must be told they can withdraw at any time.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[5 Marks] – For a comprehensive definition including the key elements (informed, voluntary, right to withdraw).

</details>
