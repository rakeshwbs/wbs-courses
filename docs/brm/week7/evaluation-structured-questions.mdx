### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 7 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Explain the core difference between **Probability Sampling** and **Non-Probability Sampling**. State which method is preferred for research that aims to generalize findings to a wider population and explain why.
[10]

**Answer:**

The core difference lies in **randomization**. In **Probability Sampling**, every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. The selection process is random, which minimizes bias. In **Non-Probability Sampling**, the selection is non-random and is based on criteria like convenience or the researcher's judgment; not everyone has a chance to be included.

**Probability sampling** is strongly preferred for research that aims to generalize findings.

**Reason:** Because the sample is selected randomly, it is more likely to be representative of the entire population. This representativeness allows researchers to have confidence that the findings from the sample (e.g., the average opinion) accurately reflect the findings they would get if they could study the entire population, within a certain margin of error.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For correctly explaining the core difference (random vs. non-random selection).
* [2 Marks] - For correctly identifying Probability Sampling as the method for generalization.
* [4 Marks] - For clearly explaining *why* it's better for generalization (reduces bias, leads to a more representative sample).

(b) For each of the following scenarios, identify the specific sampling method being used.
[15]

1. A researcher selects every 50th student from a university's complete enrollment list.
2. A journalist interviews people as they happen to walk past on a busy street.
3. A researcher studying a rare medical condition finds one patient and asks them to refer other patients they know.
4. A company divides employees into 'junior', 'mid-level', and 'senior' groups and then randomly selects 20 people from each group.
5. To understand corporate strategy, a researcher hand-picks 10 specific, highly successful CEOs to interview.

3. **Snowball Sampling**
4. **Stratified Sampling**
5. **Purposive (or Judgmental) Sampling**

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For each correctly identified sampling method (Total of 15 marks).

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A researcher wants to survey students at a large university (20,000 students) to understand their average weekly spending on food. The researcher has access to a complete, up-to-date list of all registered students with their student ID numbers.

1. Identify the **population** and the **sampling frame** for this study.
2. Describe how the researcher could use **Simple Random Sampling** to select a sample of 400 students.
[12]

**Answer:**

**1. Population and Sampling Frame:**
* **Population:** All 20,000 registered students at the large university.
* **Sampling Frame:** The complete, up-to-date list of all registered students with their ID numbers.

**2. Simple Random Sampling Method:**
The researcher would assign a number to each of the 20,000 students in the list (or use their existing student IDs). They would then use a computer program (like a random number generator in SPSS, Excel, or a dedicated website) to generate a list of 400 unique random numbers between 1 and 20,000. The students whose numbers correspond to the randomly generated numbers would be selected for the sample. Every student has an equal chance of being selected.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For correctly identifying both the population and sampling frame.
* [4 Marks] - For describing the process of assigning numbers to the population.
* [4 Marks] - For explaining the use of a random number generator to select the final sample.

(b) Continuing with the same scenario, the researcher knows that students are split across three faculties: Arts (which makes up 60% of the student body), Science (30%), and Engineering (10%). They are worried that a simple random sample might not get enough engineering students to be representative.

1. Which sampling method would be best to ensure proportional representation from all three faculties?
2. Briefly explain the steps the researcher would take to implement this method for their sample of 400 students.
[13]

<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Best Sampling Method:** **Stratified Sampling**.

**2. Implementation Steps:**
* **Step 1: Divide into Strata:** The researcher would first divide the entire sampling frame of 20,000 students into three separate lists (strata) based on their faculty: one list for Arts, one for Science, and one for Engineering.
* **Step 2: Calculate Proportional Sample Sizes:** They would calculate how many students to select from each stratum to match the population proportions:
  * Arts: 60% of 400 = 240 students.
  * Science: 30% of 400 = 120 students.
  * Engineering: 10% of 400 = 40 students.
* **Step 3: Perform Simple Random Sampling:** The researcher would then perform a separate simple random sample within each stratum. They would randomly select 240 students from the Arts list, 120 students from the Science list, and 40 students from the Engineering list.

This process ensures the final sample of 400 students accurately reflects the faculty proportions of the entire university.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying Stratified Sampling.
* [4 Marks] - For explaining the first step: dividing the population into strata.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly calculating the proportional sample sizes for each stratum.
* [3 Marks] - For explaining the final step: performing simple random sampling within each stratum.
