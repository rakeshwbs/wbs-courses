## **Week 7: Selecting Your Subjects (Sampling)**

It's usually impossible to collect data from every single person in a group you're interested in (e.g., all coffee drinkers in the world). Instead, we select a smaller group, known as a **sample**. **Sampling** is the process of selecting this group from the larger **population**. The goal is to use the sample to make inferences or generalizations about the entire population.

### **Key Terms**
* **Population:** The entire group you want to draw conclusions about.
* **Sample:** The specific group of individuals you will collect data from.
* **Sampling Frame:** A list of every individual in the population from which a sample is drawn (e.g., a company's employee directory, a list of all registered students at a university).

### **1. Probability Sampling Methods**

In probability (or random) sampling, every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. This method reduces bias and is essential for quantitative research where the goal is to generalize findings to the whole population.

* **Simple Random Sampling:** Every individual has an equal chance of being chosen. This is like drawing names out of a hat.
* **Systematic Sampling:** You select individuals at regular intervals from a list. For example, you pick a random starting point and then select every 10th person on the list.
* **Stratified Sampling:** You divide the population into subgroups (strata) based on a shared characteristic (e.g., by department: Sales, HR, IT). Then, you take a simple random sample from *within each subgroup*. This guarantees that you have proportional representation from all key groups.
* **Cluster Sampling:** You divide the population into clusters (usually geographic, like different cities or factory locations). You then randomly select several *entire clusters* to be a part of your sample.

### **2. Non-Probability Sampling Methods**

In non-probability sampling, individuals are selected using non-random criteria. Not every member of the population has a chance of being included. This is often used in qualitative or exploratory research where the goal isn't generalization, but in-depth understanding.

* **Convenience Sampling:** You select individuals who are simply the easiest to reach. For example, surveying students in your own class. It's fast and easy but highly susceptible to bias.
* **Quota Sampling:** You identify subgroups and set a target number (a quota) for each. For example, "I need 20 men and 20 women." You then fill these quotas using convenience sampling. It's a non-random attempt to get representation.
* **Purposive (or Judgmental) Sampling:** The researcher uses their expertise to hand-pick participants who are most relevant to the research question. For example, if studying the challenges of CEOs, you would purposefully seek out and interview CEOs.
* **Snowball Sampling:** You find a few initial participants and then ask them to refer you to others they know. This is useful for reaching hard-to-find populations (e.g., street artists, members of a specific club).

### **A Note on Sample Size**

"How many people do I need?" is a common and complex question. While larger samples are generally more representative and provide more statistical power, the ideal size depends on many factors, including your research design, desired confidence level, and the variability within the population. The key takeaway is that the *quality* of the sampling method is often more important than the absolute size of the sample.
