## Lab 7: Data Transformation in SPSS

### Objective
To learn how to create new variables from existing data using the `Compute Variable` command and how to regroup continuous data into categories using the `Recode into Different Variables` command.

### Part A: The Scenario and Data

For this lab, we need the job satisfaction data from last week. This file should have scores for four job satisfaction items (`JS1`, `JS2`, `JS3`, `JS4`).

**Your Tasks:**
1.  Create a single, overall "Total Satisfaction Score" by averaging the four items.
2.  Recode the "Age" variable into categorical "Age Groups".

**Action:** Please open your `Week6_Lab.sav` file. If you don't have it handy, please create a new file and enter this data:

| Participant_ID | Age | JS1 | JS2 | JS3 | JS4 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 25 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 |
| 2 | 32 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 28 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| 4 | 45 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |
| 5 | 38 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 6 | 29 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 |
| 7 | 41 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| 8 | 33 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| 9 | 48 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 |
| 10 | 30 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 |

### Part B: Creating a Total Score with `Compute Variable`

We'll combine the four `JS` items into a single average score.

1.  From the SPSS menu, go to: **Transform -> Compute Variable...**
2.  In the 'Target Variable' box at the top-left, type the name for our new variable: `Total_Satisfaction`.
3.  In the 'Numeric Expression' box on the right, type the following formula to calculate the average:
`(JS1 + JS2 + JS3 + JS4) / 4`
4.  Click **OK**.
5.  Go to your **Data View** window. You will see a new column at the end named `Total_Satisfaction` containing the calculated average score for each participant.

### Part C: Regrouping a Variable with `Recode into Different Variables`

Next, we'll convert the continuous `Age` variable into three distinct age groups. We use "Recode into **Different** Variables" because it's saferâ€”it keeps your original `Age` variable unchanged.

1.  From the SPSS menu, go to: **Transform -> Recode into Different Variables...**
2.  Move the `Age` variable from the left box into the center 'Input Variable -> Output Variable' box.
3.  On the right side, under 'Output Variable', type a **Name** for the new variable (e.g., `Age_Group`) and a descriptive **Label** (e.g., "Participant Age Groups"). Click the **Change** button.
4.  Now, click the **Old and New Values...** button. This is where you define the new groups.
5.  We will create three groups:
* On the left side, select **Range** and type `20` through `29`. On the right side, in the 'Value' box, type `1`. Click **Add**.
* Select **Range** again. Type `30` through `39`. In the 'Value' box, type `2`. Click **Add**.
* Select **Range, value through HIGHEST**. Type `40`. In the 'Value' box, type `3`. Click **Add**.
6.  Click **Continue**, then click **OK**.
7.  A new `Age_Group` column will appear in your Data View. Go to the **Variable View** and for the `Age_Group` variable, click on the **Values** cell to define the labels:
* `1` = "20-29 years"
* `2` = "30-39 years"
* `3` = "40+ years"

You have now successfully transformed your data, making it ready for different types of analysis!
