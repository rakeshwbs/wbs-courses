### Module Aims
This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of systematic business research.
It is designed to equip students with the essential knowledge and skills required to conduct research,
solve problems, and meet the challenges of a modern decision-making environment.
The course aims to build a strong foundation in research methodology, from conceptualization and design to data
analysis and reporting, preparing students to undertake a formal thesis or major project paper.

**Synopsis**
Throughout this module, learners will become acquainted with a range of research methodologies, including survey and field research, questionnaire design, content analysis, and both individual and group observation techniques. Emphasis is placed on the practical application of these methods to contemporary business and policy issues. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to quantitative data analysis using statistical software (SPSS). Furthermore, the module addresses the critical importance of ethical considerations in research, covering topics such as voluntary participation, confidentiality, and professional codes of ethics.

**Learning Outcomes**
On the completion of this module, students should be able to:
1.  **CLO 1:** Design a research plan.
2.  **CLO 2:** Use the appropriate statistical test to analyze data.
3.  **CLO 3:** Write a research proposal using proper format and referencing.
4.  **CLO 4:** Present the research proposal.
5.  **CLO 5:** Apply ethical values in preparing the research proposal.

**Teaching and Learning Strategy**
Learning is facilitated through a blend of formal lectures that introduce core theories, interactive tutorials that explore concepts in-depth, and essential hands-on practical lab sessions for data analysis.

**Assessment Method**
* Research Proposal: 60%
* Presentation: 20%
* Final Examination: 20%

|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1** | **Introduction to Research** | The role of theory, the research process overview, and different approaches in research. | **Getting Started with SPSS** | Introduction to the SPSS interface (Data View vs. Variable View). Practice entering basic data. |
| **2** | **Research Methodology** | The language of research, including concepts, constructs, variables, and definitions. | **Defining Variables** | Setting up a data file by defining variable properties (name, type, label, values, measure). |
| **3** | **Research Problems** | How to formulate compelling research questions and develop testable research hypotheses. | **Data Entry & Cleaning** | Importing data from Excel and practicing data screening to identify errors or outliers. |
| **4** | **Research Design** | Exploring different research designs, including experimental, non-experimental, field, and survey research. | **Data Transformation (Part 1)** | Using the `Compute Variable` function to create new variables from existing data (e.g., calculating a total score from several items). |
| **5** | **Data Collection** | An overview of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. | **Data Transformation (Part 2)** | Using the `Recode into Different Variables` function to group continuous data into categories (e.g., grouping age into ranges). |
| **6** | **Measurement & Scaling** | Types of measurement scales, questionnaire design, and the concepts of reliability and validity. | **Reliability Analysis** | Assessing the internal consistency of a multi-item scale using Cronbach's Alpha. |
| **7** | **Sampling Techniques** | Discussing nature, probability, and non-probability sampling methods, and determining sample size. | **Descriptive Statistics** | Generating frequency tables, measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), and measures of dispersion (standard deviation). |
| **8** | **Data Analysis (Part 1): Descriptive Statistics & Graphing** | In-depth review of descriptive analysis. | **Data Visualization** | Creating charts and graphs in SPSS, such as histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots, to visually represent data. |
| **9** | **Data Analysis (Part 2): Inferential Statistics** | Introduction to t-Tests (Independent & Paired Samples) and the Chi-Square test. | **Hypothesis Testing (Part 1)** | Performing Independent Samples t-Tests, Paired Samples t-Tests, and Chi-Square tests to compare groups and analyze relationships. |
| **10** | **Data Analysis (Part 3): Inferential Statistics** | Introduction to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Regression analysis. | **Hypothesis Testing (Part 2)** | Performing One-Way ANOVA to compare the means of multiple groups and Simple Linear Regression to predict outcomes. |
| **11** | **Preparation of Research Proposal/Protocol** | Structuring and writing a formal research proposal. | **Reporting Results** | Interpreting SPSS output tables and learning how to correctly report statistical findings in a research paper. **Research Proposal Due.** |
| **12** | **Research Ethics & Publication** | Ethics committee, plagiarism, copyright, referencing, and preparing for publication. | **Final Project Workshop & Presentations** | Students present their data analysis results. Final Q&A session and course wrap-up. **Final Presentations.** |
