## Week 11: Assembling Your Blueprint (The Research Proposal)

A **research proposal** is a formal, structured document that outlines your proposed research project. It explains *what* you want to study, *why* it's important, and *how* you will do it. It is the complete plan you submit for approval before you begin your actual data collection for a thesis or major project. üìù

### **Purpose of a Research Proposal**

* **To Persuade:** It must convince your supervisor, ethics committee, or funding body that your research is well-designed, important, feasible, and ethical.
* **To Plan:** It acts as your personal roadmap for the entire project, keeping you on track.
* **To Demonstrate Competence:** It shows that you have a thorough understanding of your topic and the research process.

### **Key Sections of a Standard Research Proposal**

While formats can vary slightly, most proposals include the following sections:

#### **1. Title Page**
A clear, descriptive title for your project, along with your name and institutional details.

#### **2. Introduction & Background**
* Introduce the general topic and provide the necessary background to orient the reader.
* Clearly state the **research problem**. What is the issue or gap in knowledge that makes this study necessary?
* Briefly outline the purpose and significance of your study. Why does this research matter?

#### **3. Literature Review**
* This is a critical synthesis of existing academic work on your topic.
* It's **not** just a summary of articles. It should identify what is known, highlight controversies or debates, and clearly identify the **gap** in the literature that your research will address.
* This section logically leads to and justifies your research questions.

#### **4. Research Questions & Hypotheses**
* Clearly and formally state your specific research questions.
* Formally state your testable hypotheses, both the null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_1$).

#### **5. Methodology**
This is the detailed "how-to" section. It must be specific enough for another researcher to replicate your study.
* **Research Design:** State and justify your chosen design (e.g., quantitative correlational survey, qualitative case study, true experiment).
* **Participants & Sampling:** Describe your target **population**, the **sampling frame**, the specific **sampling method** you'll use (e.g., convenience, stratified random), and your proposed **sample size**.
* **Data Collection Methods:** Describe the tools you will use (e.g., a specific survey instrument, an interview protocol) and the step-by-step procedure for collecting data.
* **Data Analysis Plan:** Explicitly state which statistical tests you will use to analyze your data and test each hypothesis (e.g., "Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant demographics. H1 will be tested using an independent-samples t-test.").

#### **6. Ethical Considerations**
* Outline how you will handle key ethical issues, such as obtaining informed consent, ensuring participant confidentiality and anonymity, and securing data.

#### **7. Timeline**
* Provide a realistic schedule for completing each stage of your research project. A Gantt chart is often used for this.

#### **8. References**
* A complete list of all sources cited in your proposal, formatted in a consistent style (e.g., APA, Harvard).
