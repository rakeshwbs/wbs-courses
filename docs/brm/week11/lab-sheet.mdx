## Lab 11: Preparing Output for Your Research Proposal

### Objective
To learn how to format, copy, and export tables and charts from the SPSS Output window into a text document (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs).

### Part A: Generating Sample Output

First, we need some results to work with. We'll re-run the One-Way ANOVA from last week's lab.

1.  Open your **`Week10_Lab.sav`** file (the one with the drug trial data).
2.  Run the One-Way ANOVA again as a reminder:
* Go to **Analyze -> Compare Means -> One-Way ANOVA...**
* Put `Recovery_Days` in the 'Dependent List' and `Group` in the 'Factor' box.
* Under **Post Hoc...**, select **Tukey**.
* Under **Options...**, select **Descriptives**.
* Click **OK**.
3.  You should now have an SPSS Output window containing a Descriptives table, an ANOVA table, and a Post Hoc table.

### Part B: Copying and Formatting Tables

You can copy tables directly from the Output window into your document.

1.  **Simple Copy/Paste (The Quick Way):**
* In the SPSS Output window, find the main **ANOVA** table.
* **Right-click** directly on the table.
* Select **Copy**.
* Open a text document (like MS Word) and **Paste** (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`). The table should appear, and you can edit it like any other table in Word.

2.  **Editing Tables Before Copying (The Professional Way):**
* In the SPSS Output window, **double-click** on the ANOVA table. This will activate the **Pivot Table Editor**.
* Now you can edit the table. For example, you can right-click on the title of a column you don't need (like "Sum of Squares") and select "Delete" to simplify the table for your report.
* Once you're done editing, close the Pivot Table Editor window. The changes will be saved in your output.
* Now, you can right-click and copy the newly formatted table.

### Part C: Copying and Formatting Charts

Let's create a bar chart of the group means to practice with.

1.  From the menu, go to: **Graphs -> Chart Builder...**
2.  From the 'Gallery', choose **Bar**. Drag the first simple bar chart icon into the preview area.
3.  Drag your categorical variable, `Group`, onto the **X-Axis**.
4.  Drag your continuous variable, `Recovery_Days`, onto the **Y-Axis**. The default statistic will be 'Mean', which is what we want.
5.  Click **OK**. A bar chart will appear in your Output window.
6.  **Editing the Chart:** Just like with tables, you can **double-click** on the chart to open the **Chart Editor**. Here you can change colors, edit the title, add labels, and much more to make it look professional.
7.  **Copying the Chart:** Once you've finished editing, close the Chart Editor. **Right-click** on the final chart in your Output window and select **Copy**. Paste it into your document.



### Part D: Exporting the Entire Output File

If you have many tables and charts, you can export the entire output file at once.

1.  In the SPSS Output window, go to the menu: **File -> Export...**
2.  An "Export Output" dialog box will appear.
3.  Under 'Export Format', in the **'Type:'** dropdown menu, select the format you want, such as **"Word/RTF (*.doc)"** or **"PDF (*.pdf)"**.
4.  Click the **'Browse...'** button to choose where to save your file and give it a name.
5.  Click **OK**. SPSS will create a single document containing all the tables and charts from your output session.
