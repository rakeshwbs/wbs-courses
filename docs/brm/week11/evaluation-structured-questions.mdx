**Answer:**

The primary purpose of a **Literature Review** is to provide a critical synthesis of existing academic knowledge on a topic, rather than simply summarizing other studies.

It must accomplish three key things:
1. **Demonstrate Knowledge:** Show familiarity with the important existing work in the field.
2. **Situate the Research:** Place the proposed study within the context of the ongoing academic conversation, showing how it relates to previous work.
3. **Justify the Research:** Identify a **gap** in the current literature that needs to be addressed, which becomes the rationale for the study.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - Clear statement of the primary purpose (synthesis of existing knowledge).
* [2 Marks each] - For correctly identifying and explaining the three accomplishments (Total 6 marks).

(b) A company wants to study the impact of a new four-day work week policy on employee job satisfaction.

1. Write a clear, specific **Research Question**.
2. Formulate a **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**.
3. Formulate a **Directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**.
[15]

**Answer:**

**1. Research Question:**
Is there a significant difference in average job satisfaction scores between employees on a four-day work week and those on a traditional five-day work week?

**2. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is no significant difference in the mean job satisfaction scores between employees on a four-day work week and those on a five-day work week.

**3. Directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
Employees on a four-day work week will have **higher** mean job satisfaction scores than those on a five-day work week.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - Clear and researchable question.
* [5 Marks] - Correct null hypothesis stating no difference.
* [5 Marks] - Correct directional alternative hypothesis specifying the direction.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) You are writing the **Methodology** section for a research proposal. Name and briefly describe the three key sub-sections that detail *who* you will study, *how* you will collect data, and *how* you will analyze it.
[12]

<details>

**Answer:**

1. **Participants & Sampling:** Describes *who* will be in the study, the target population, sampling frame, sampling method (e.g., convenience, stratified random), and proposed sample size.
2. **Data Collection Methods / Procedures:** Explains *how* data will be gathered, including instruments used (e.g., survey, interview protocol) and the procedure for administration.
3. **Data Analysis Plan:** States *how* the collected data will be analyzed, including which descriptive and inferential statistical tests will be used to test the hypotheses.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - Participants & Sampling.
* [4 Marks] - Data Collection Methods.
* [4 Marks] - Data Analysis Plan.

</details>

(b) Why is the **Data Analysis Plan** a critical part of a research proposal *before* data collection? Provide an example for a study testing the difference in a continuous DV between two groups.
[13]

**Answer:**

The Data Analysis Plan is critical because it ensures that the data being collected is **appropriate for the intended statistical tests**, directly linking research questions to methods. Planning ahead avoids collecting unusable data and ensures the research design can answer the hypotheses.

**Example:**
"The collected data will first be screened for accuracy and summarized using descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations). To test the primary hypothesis that there is a difference in [continuous DV] between [Group 1] and [Group 2], an **independent-samples t-test** will be conducted. The significance level will be set at $\alpha = 0.05$."

**Marking Scheme:**
* [6 Marks] - Clear explanation of why the plan is critical (ensures appropriate data, links questions to methods).
* [7 Marks] - Suitable example with correct test, descriptive stats, and alpha level.
