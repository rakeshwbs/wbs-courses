### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 3 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A manager of an e-commerce company states their problem: "Our customer retention rate has dropped significantly over the last two quarters."

Translate this **management problem** into a more focused **research problem** and then formulate one specific **research question**.

**Answer:**

**Research Problem:** To identify and evaluate the key factors influencing a customer's decision to stop making purchases from our e-commerce platform.

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between website usability, customer service response time, and product delivery speed on our customer retention rate?

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For formulating a clear research problem that reframes the management problem into a topic for investigation.
* [6 Marks] - For formulating a specific, researchable question that names potential variables and guides the study.

</details>

(b) Based on the research question from part (a), formulate a clear **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** and a **Directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)** for the relationship between "customer service response time" and "customer retention rate".

**Answer:**

**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is **no relationship** between customer service response time and the customer retention rate.

**Directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
A **faster** customer service response time will lead to a **higher** customer retention rate.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For a correct Null Hypothesis that states no effect or no relationship.
* [5 Marks] - For a correct Directional Alternative Hypothesis that specifies the direction of the relationship (e.g., faster → higher, or slower → lower).

</details>

(c) What does it mean for a hypothesis to be **falsifiable**, and why is this principle important in scientific research?

**Answer:**

**Falsifiability** means that it must be logically possible to collect empirical evidence that could contradict or disprove the hypothesis. If a hypothesis cannot be tested and potentially proven wrong, it is not a scientific one.

**Importance:** This principle is crucial because it is what separates science from non-science. It forces research to be grounded in observable evidence and prevents researchers from making claims that are so vague or universal that they can never be challenged. It ensures that scientific knowledge can be corrected and refined over time.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For a clear definition of falsifiability (possibility of being proven wrong).
* [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of its importance (separates science from non-science, ensures testability).

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) The FINER criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a research question. Choose any **two** letters from the FINER acronym, state what each stands for, and explain its importance.
[10]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**
*(Any two of the following are acceptable)*

1. **F - Feasible:** This means the researcher must have the practical resources—adequate funding, time, technical expertise, and access to participants—to actually complete the study.
   * **Importance:** An amazing research question is useless if it's impossible to answer. Feasibility ensures that the project can be realistically executed from start to finish.

2. **I - Interesting:** The question should be interesting to the investigator, their peers, and the wider community.
   * **Importance:** Interest provides the motivation to endure the rigorous research process and helps ensure the final results will be engaging and impactful to an audience.

3. **N - Novel:** The research should add something new to the body of knowledge, whether by confirming or refuting previous findings, extending them in a new way, or exploring a completely new topic.
   * **Importance:** Novelty ensures that research isn't just "reinventing the wheel." It is the mechanism by which knowledge progresses.

4. **E - Ethical:** The study must be designed in a way that is ethical and does not cause harm to participants. It must respect principles like informed consent and confidentiality.
   * **Importance:** This is a non-negotiable moral imperative. Unethical research is unacceptable regardless of its potential findings.

5. **R - Relevant:** The question should be relevant to scientific knowledge, clinical and health policy, or future research directions.
   * **Importance:** Relevance ensures that the research has a purpose and that its findings will be useful and contribute meaningfully to the field.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For each correctly identified and explained criterion (2 marks for the explanation, 3 marks for the importance).

(b) A company introduces a new, simplified software interface (IV) to see if it impacts employee productivity (DV).

1. State the **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** for this study. [5]
2. State a **Non-directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)** for this study. [10]

[15]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is **no difference** in average employee productivity between employees using the new software interface and those using the old interface.

**2. Non-directional Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
There **is a significant difference** in average employee productivity between employees using the new software interface and those using the old interface.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For a clear and correct Null Hypothesis stating no difference.
* [10 Marks] - For a clear and correct Non-directional Alternative Hypothesis that states a difference exists but does not specify whether productivity will increase or decrease.
