## **Week 3: From Problems to Predictions**

Good research provides good answers, but it always starts with a good question. This is the funnel-like process of turning a vague problem into a sharp, testable hypothesis.

### **1. The Hierarchy of Research Questions**

We can think of the process as moving down a ladder of specificity:

1.  **Management Problem:** A broad, practical issue or symptom faced by a manager. It's often expressed as a dilemma.
* *Example:* "We are losing market share to a new competitor."

2.  **Research Problem:** The management problem is rephrased into a more focused issue that highlights the need for information. It gets closer to the potential causes.
* *Example:* "To determine the key factors that are causing our customers to switch to the new competitor."

3.  **Research Question (RQ):** A specific, refined question that the research aims to answer directly.
* *Example:* "How does our product's perceived quality, price, and brand image compare to that of our new competitor in the eyes of our target customers?"

### **2. What Makes a Good Research Question?**

A strong research question should meet the **FINER** criteria:
* **F**easible: Can you actually complete the study with the time, resources, and expertise available?
* **I**nteresting: Is the question interesting to you, your peers, and the industry?
* **N**ovel: Does it confirm, refute, or extend previous findings? Does it provide new insights?
* **E**thical: Can the question be answered without harming participants?
* **R**elevant: Is it relevant to current scientific knowledge, business practices, or policy?

### **3. Developing Testable Hypotheses**

Once you have a research question, you can develop a hypothesis.

A **hypothesis** is a formal, testable statement about the expected relationship between variables. It's your prediction of the outcome, based on theory or prior knowledge.

**Key Characteristics:**
* It's a declarative statement, not a question.
* It is **falsifiable**â€”it must be possible to collect data that could prove it wrong.
* It clearly states the relationship between an independent variable (IV) and a dependent variable (DV).

### **4. Null vs. Alternative Hypotheses**

In statistical testing, we always work with two competing hypotheses:

#### **The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**
This is a statement of **no effect** or **no relationship**. It proposes that any pattern you see in your data is just due to random chance. The goal of research is often to gather enough evidence to **reject the null hypothesis**.
* *Example:* "$H_0$: There is **no difference** in average sales between stores that use the new marketing display and those that do not."

#### **The Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_A$)**
This is the researcher's actual prediction. It states that a real relationship or difference **does exist**. It's what you hope to support with your data.

There are two types of alternative hypotheses:

1.  **Directional Hypothesis:** Specifies the *direction* of the relationship (more, less, higher, lower).
* *Example:* "$H_1$: Stores that use the new marketing display will have **higher** average sales than those that do not."

2.  **Non-directional Hypothesis:** States that a relationship exists but does not specify the direction.
* *Example:* "$H_1$: There **is a significant difference** in average sales between stores that use the new marketing display and those that do not."
