## Lab 12: Presenting Findings and Ethical Review

### Objective
To practice structuring a research presentation and to apply ethical principles by reviewing a research scenario.

### Part A: Structuring a Research Presentation

Imagine you have just completed the ANOVA study from Week 10, where you found that a new drug significantly reduced patient recovery time. Your task is to prepare a brief, 4-slide presentation for your manager.

**Task:** On a piece of paper or in a simple document, outline the content for each of the following four slides.

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
* What is the title of your presentation?
* Who is the presenter (your name)?

**Slide 2: Background & Methods**
* Briefly state the **research question**.
* Briefly describe the **methodology**:
  * What was the **research design** (e.g., experimental)?
  * How many **participants** and how were they **grouped**?
  * What was the **dependent variable**?

**Slide 3: Key Results**
* State the main finding in plain English.
* Include a title for a bar chart that would visually show the difference in mean recovery days between the three groups (e.g., "Figure 1: Mean Recovery Days by Treatment Group"). You don't need to draw the chart, just title it.
* State the key statistical result that supports your finding (e.g., "The result was statistically significant, p < .001").

**Slide 4: Conclusion & Recommendation**
* What is your main **conclusion** from this study?
* Based on your conclusion, what is your **recommendation** to the manager?

### Part B: Ethical Review Exercise

Read the following short research scenario and identify at least **three major ethical issues**. For each issue, explain why it is a problem.

**Scenario:**
*A university student wants to study the spending habits of their classmates for a research methods course. The student creates a survey asking detailed questions about income, spending on non-essential items, and debt levels. To get enough participants, the student tells their classmates that completing the survey is a mandatory requirement for passing the course, though it is not. The survey does not ask for names, so the student tells participants it is "anonymous." However, because the student personally hands out and collects the surveys in their small tutorial class, they can easily recognize their classmates' handwriting. In their final report, the student includes a few sentences copied directly from a published journal article without using quotation marks or providing a citation.*

**Task:**
1.  Identify Ethical Issue #1 and explain the problem.
2.  Identify Ethical Issue #2 and explain the problem.
3.  Identify Ethical Issue #3 and explain the problem.
