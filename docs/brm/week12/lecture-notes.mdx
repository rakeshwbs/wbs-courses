## Week 12: Sharing Your Work and Upholding Integrity (Publication & Ethics)

### Part 1: Research Ethics - The Foundation of Good Science

Ethical conduct is not an optional extra; it's the absolute foundation of all credible research. While we've touched on this, let's formalize the key principles.

* **Informed Consent:** Participants must be fully informed about the research (its purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits) and voluntarily agree to take part. They must also know they can withdraw at any time without penalty.
* **Confidentiality & Anonymity:** You must protect your participants' identities.
  * **Confidentiality:** The researcher knows the participant's identity but promises not to disclose it.
  * **Anonymity:** Even the researcher does not know the identity of the participant.
* **Minimizing Harm:** A researcher's primary responsibility is to ensure participants are not subjected to any unnecessary physical or psychological harm.

#### **Major Research Misconduct**
* **Plagiarism:** Presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own without proper citation and credit. Academic integrity requires citing all sources. Plagiarism detection software is standard in all universities.
* **Fabrication & Falsification:**
  * **Fabrication:** Making up data or results.
  * **Falsification:** Manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing/omitting data so that the research is not accurately represented.
  * Both are considered cardinal sins in research and can end a career.

### Part 2: From Research Report to Published Article

The goal of academic research is to contribute to the body of knowledge. This is done through publication in academic journals.

#### **The Peer Review Process**
This process is the quality control system of science.
1.  **Submission:** A researcher writes their study up as a formal article (a manuscript) and submits it to a suitable academic journal.
2.  **Editorial Assessment:** The journal's editor does an initial check. If it's a good fit, they send it to several other experts in the same field.
3.  **Peer Review:** These anonymous experts (the "peers") critically evaluate the research methodology, analysis, and conclusions. They provide feedback and recommend whether the paper should be published.
4.  **Decision:** Based on the reviews, the editor makes a decision:
* **Accept:** The paper is published as is (very rare).
* **Minor/Major Revisions:** The researcher must make changes and resubmit.
* **Reject:** The paper is not suitable for publication in that journal.

#### **Key Terms in Publishing**
* **Impact Factor:** A metric that reflects the average number of citations to recent articles published in a specific journal. Higher impact factor journals are generally considered more prestigious.
* **Acknowledgements:** A section in the published article where the authors thank individuals or organizations that helped with the research (e.g., providing funding, statistical advice) but who do not qualify for authorship.
* **Copyright:** When an article is accepted, the author typically signs a **Copyright Waiver or Transfer Agreement**, which gives the publisher the exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the work.

### **Course Wrap-Up**
Congratulations! Over the past 12 weeks, you have journeyed through the entire research processâ€”from defining a vague problem, to designing a study, collecting and analyzing data, and now, understanding how to share your work ethically and professionally. You now have the foundational knowledge for conducting sound business research.
