## **Week 6: How We Measure (Measurement, Scaling, and Reliability)**

**Measurement** is the process of assigning numbers or labels to concepts and variables in your research. The quality of your entire study rests on the quality of your measurement.

### **Levels of Measurement (A Deeper Look)**

We've touched on these before, but let's formalize them. There are four fundamental levels of measurement, and they determine which statistical analyses you can perform.

1.  **Nominal:** The simplest level. Numbers are used only as labels for categories, with no order.
* *Examples:* Gender (1=Male, 2=Female), Department (1=Sales, 2=HR).
* You can count frequencies but can't calculate a meaningful average.

2.  **Ordinal:** This level involves categories that have a meaningful rank or order, but the distance between the ranks is not equal or known.
* *Examples:* T-shirt sizes (Small, Medium, Large), finishing positions in a race (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
* You know that 'Large' is bigger than 'Small', but not by how much.

3.  **Interval:** This scale has a meaningful order AND the "intervals" or distances between the points are equal and meaningful. However, it lacks a "true zero."
* *Example:* Temperature in Celsius. The difference between 10°C and 20°C is the same as between 20°C and 30°C. But 0°C doesn't mean "no temperature."

4.  **Ratio:** This is the highest level of measurement. It has order, equal intervals, AND a true, meaningful zero point, which represents the complete absence of the variable.
* *Examples:* Age, Weight, Sales in dollars, Number of children. A value of zero means "none."

### **Scaling Techniques in Questionnaires**

A **scale** is a tool designed to measure a complex construct (like an attitude) by combining scores from several questions or items.

* **Likert Scale:** This is the most common scale. Respondents rate their level of agreement with a statement.
  * *Example:* "I am satisfied with my job."
  * `(1) Strongly Disagree` `(2) Disagree` `(3) Neutral` `(4) Agree` `(5) Strongly Agree`

* **Semantic Differential Scale:** Respondents rate a concept on a scale anchored by two bipolar (opposite) adjectives.
  * *Example:* "Our customer service is:"
  * `Unreliable` `O--O--O--O--O` `Reliable`
  * `Slow` `O--O--O--O--O` `Fast`

### **Good Measurement: The Concept of Reliability**

For a measurement tool (like a survey scale) to be good, it must be reliable and valid. We'll focus on reliability this week.

**Reliability** refers to the **consistency** of a measurement. If you measure the same thing multiple times under the same conditions, a reliable tool will produce the same or very similar results. It's about dependability and stability.

* **Internal Consistency Reliability:** This is the most common type used for scales. It checks if the various items on a single scale, which are all supposed to be measuring the same underlying construct, are consistent with each other. For example, if you have a 5-item scale to measure "Job Satisfaction," a person who is truly satisfied should score high on all 5 items.
* **How We Measure It:** We use a statistic called **Cronbach's Alpha ($\alpha$)**.
  * This value ranges from 0 to 1.
  * A higher value indicates greater internal consistency among the items.
  * **Rule of Thumb:** A Cronbach's Alpha value of **$\alpha > 0.70$** is generally considered acceptable for research purposes.
