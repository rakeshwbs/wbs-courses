### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 6 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) For each of the four fundamental levels of measurement, provide its name, a brief definition, and one clear business-related example.

**Answer:**

1. **Nominal:**
   * **DefinitionBox:** Categories that are used for labeling only, with no quantitative value or order.
   * **Example:** The `Department` an employee works in (e.g., 1=Sales, 2=Marketing, 3=IT).

2. **Ordinal:**
   * **DefinitionBox:** Categories that have a meaningful rank or order, but the intervals between the ranks are not equal.
   * **Example:** Customer satisfaction ratings (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).

3. **Interval:**
   * **DefinitionBox:** Data that has a meaningful order and equal, meaningful intervals between values, but lacks a true zero.
   * **Example:** The temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit) of a server room.

4. **Ratio:**
   * **DefinitionBox:** Data that has a meaningful order, equal intervals, and a true, meaningful zero point.
   * **Example:** A company's `Quarterly Revenue` in dollars ($0 means no revenue).

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For each level of measurement correctly named, defined, and exemplified (Total of 12 marks).

(b) Define **reliability** in the context of research measurement. Then, explain what **Cronbach's Alpha ($\alpha$)** is used for and state the generally accepted threshold for a "good" alpha value.

**Answer:**

**Reliability** refers to the **consistency** and **stability** of a measurement tool. A reliable measure will produce the same or very similar results if used multiple times to measure the same thing under the same conditions. It is about the dependability of the measurement.

**Cronbach's Alpha ($\alpha$)** is a statistical coefficient used to measure the **internal consistency** of a multi-item scale. It assesses how well a set of items collectively measures a single underlying construct by checking if the items are highly correlated with one another.

The generally accepted threshold for good reliability is a Cronbach's Alpha value of **$\alpha \geq 0.70$**.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For a clear definition of reliability, emphasizing consistency or stability.
* [5 Marks] - For explaining that Cronbach's Alpha measures internal consistency.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly stating the 0.70 threshold.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A researcher develops a 3-item scale to measure "Ease of Use" for a new software. After collecting data, they run a reliability analysis in SPSS and get the following results:

* The overall **Cronbach's Alpha** for the 3-item scale is **.625**.
* In the "Item-Total Statistics" table, the value in the "Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted" column for Item 2 is **.890**.

Based on these two pieces of information, what conclusion should the researcher draw about the scale's reliability, and what action should they take?

**Answer:**

**Conclusion:**
The researcher should conclude that the initial 3-item scale has **poor reliability**. The overall Cronbach's Alpha of .625 is below the acceptable threshold of 0.70, indicating that the three items are not consistently measuring the same underlying construct.

**Action to Take:**
The "Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted" value for Item 2 is critical. It shows that if Item 2 were removed, the scale's alpha would increase dramatically from .625 to .890. This new value is well above the 0.70 threshold. Therefore, the researcher should **delete Item 2** from the scale and use the remaining two items as a new, more reliable measure of "Ease of Use."

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For correctly concluding that the initial scale is unreliable, referencing the .625 value.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying the action: delete Item 2.
* [3 Marks] - For justifying the action by explaining what the "Alpha if Item Deleted" value means.

(b) You are designing a questionnaire for a fast-food chain.

1. Write a question using a **Likert scale** to measure agreement with the statement: "The menu at this restaurant offers a good variety of healthy options."
2. Write a question using a **Semantic Differential scale** to measure the perception of the restaurant's atmosphere.
3. Identify the flaw in the following question: "Was your meal delicious and served quickly?"

**Answer:**

**1. Likert Scale Question:**
Please indicate your level of agreement with the following statement: "The menu at this restaurant offers a good variety of healthy options."
`( ) Strongly Disagree  ( ) Disagree  ( ) Neutral  ( ) Agree  ( ) Strongly Agree`

**2. Semantic Differential Scale Question:**
Please describe the atmosphere of our restaurant by marking the space on the scale below that best fits your perception:
`Noisy O--O--O--O--O Quiet`
`Chaotic O--O--O--O--O Calm`

**3. Flawed Question and Explanation:**
* **Question:** "Was your meal delicious and served quickly?"
* **Flaw:** This is a **double-barreled question**. It is asking about two separate concepts (food taste and service speed) at the same time. A customer cannot give a single valid 'Yes' or 'No' answer if their meal was delicious but served slowly, or vice versa. The question should be split into two separate questions.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For a correctly formatted Likert scale question.
* [5 Marks] - For a correctly formatted Semantic Differential scale question with bipolar adjectives.
* [2 Marks] - For correctly identifying the flaw as a double-barreled question.
* [3 Marks] - For clearly explaining why it is flawed.
