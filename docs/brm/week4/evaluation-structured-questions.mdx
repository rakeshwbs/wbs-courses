### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 4 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Compare and contrast a **True Experimental Design** with a **Correlational Design**. In your answer, you must address:

1. The primary purpose of each design.
2. The level of researcher manipulation involved.
3. The type of conclusion that can be drawn about causality.

**Answer:**

1. **Primary Purpose:**
   * **True Experimental:** The primary purpose is to establish a **cause-and-effect** relationship between variables.
   * **Correlational:** The primary purpose is to identify the **existence and strength of a relationship** between variables as they naturally occur.

2. **Researcher Manipulation:**
   * **True Experimental:** The researcher is an **active manipulator**. They deliberately change the independent variable (IV) to observe its effect on the dependent variable (DV).
   * **Correlational:** The researcher is a **passive observer**. They measure variables but do not change or manipulate them in any way.

3. **Conclusion on Causality:**
   * **True Experimental:** Due to manipulation, control, and random assignment, this design allows for strong conclusions about **causality** (i.e., that a change in the IV *caused* a change in the DV).
   * **Correlational:** This design **cannot establish causality**. It can only show that two variables are related. The "correlation does not equal causation" principle applies here, as a third, unmeasured variable could be causing both.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For correctly contrasting the purpose of both designs (cause-effect vs. relationship).
* [4 Marks] - For correctly contrasting the level of manipulation (active manipulator vs. passive observer).
* [4 Marks] - For correctly contrasting the conclusions on causality.

(b) Explain what a **Quasi-Experimental Design** is and describe a scenario where it would be more appropriate to use than a True Experimental Design.

**Answer:**

A **Quasi-Experimental Design** is a type of research design that aims to estimate a cause-and-effect relationship, but it lacks the key feature of random assignment. Like a true experiment, it involves the manipulation of an independent variable, but the groups being studied are pre-existing.

**Scenario for Appropriate Use:**
A scenario where this design is more appropriate is in educational research. For instance, a researcher wants to test the effectiveness of a new teaching method. It would be unethical or impractical to randomly assign students to different schools or even different classrooms for a whole semester. Therefore, the researcher could implement the new method in one existing school (the treatment group) and use another similar, existing school as the control group. Because the groups were not formed through random assignment, it is a quasi-experiment.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For a clear definition of a quasi-experimental design, specifically mentioning the lack of random assignment.
* [4 Marks] - For providing a suitable and clear scenario (e.g., schools, cities, hospital wards).
* [4 Marks] - For clearly explaining *why* a true experiment would be impractical or unethical in that scenario, thus justifying the use of a quasi-experimental design.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A business analyst wants to conduct an in-depth investigation into the unique corporate culture of a single, highly innovative tech company to understand the factors contributing to its success.

Which research design would be most appropriate for this study? Justify your answer and state one key limitation of this design.

**Answer:**

**Most Appropriate Design:** A **Case Study**.

**Justification:** A case study is the most appropriate design because the goal is to conduct a deep, detailed, and holistic investigation of a single, bounded entity (the specific tech company). This design allows the analyst to explore multiple facets of the company's culture—such as communication styles, leadership, and daily rituals—in a rich, qualitative manner that would be impossible with other designs.

**Key Limitation:** The primary limitation of a case study is that its findings are **not generalizable**. The unique factors contributing to this one company's success may not be applicable or lead to the same results in other companies or industries.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For correctly identifying the Case Study design.
* [3 Marks] - For a clear justification linking the design's purpose (in-depth study of a single entity) to the research goal.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying and explaining the limitation (lack of generalizability).

(b) A health app company wants to test if a new feature, "Personalized Daily Reminders," causes users to increase the number of steps they take per day. They have recruited 100 new users for the study.

1. Describe how you would set up a **True Experimental Design** to answer this question. Be sure to mention the IV, DV, the two groups, and how you would assign participants.
2. Explain why **random assignment** is so critical in this specific design.
[15]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Setting up the True Experimental Design:**
* **Independent Variable (IV):** The presence or absence of the "Personalized Daily Reminders" feature.
* **Dependent Variable (DV):** The average number of steps taken per day by each user over a one-month period.
* **Groups:**
  * **Experimental Group** – receives the app with the new reminder feature activated.
  * **Control Group** – receives the standard version of the app without the new reminder feature.
* **Participant Assignment:** The 100 new users would be **randomly assigned** to one of the two groups. For example, using a computer program, each user would have a 50/50 chance of being placed in either the experimental or control group, resulting in approximately 50 users per group.

**2. The Critical Role of Random Assignment:**
Random assignment is critical because it ensures that, at the beginning of the study, the two groups are statistically equivalent on all other variables (e.g., initial motivation levels, age, fitness habits). It minimizes the risk that any difference found in the number of steps at the end of the study is due to some pre-existing difference between the groups. By randomly assigning users, we can be much more confident that any observed difference in the DV is actually *caused* by the IV (the reminder feature) and not by some other confounding factor.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [6 Marks] - For a clear description of the experimental setup (2 for identifying IV/DV, 2 for groups, 2 for assignment process).
* [4 Marks] - For a clear explanation of what random assignment does (creates equivalent groups).
* [5 Marks] - For explaining *why* this is critical (minimizes bias, strengthens causal claims, rules out alternative explanations).
