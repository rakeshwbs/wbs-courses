## Lab 4: Importing Data and Understanding Structure

### Objective
To learn how to import data from a Microsoft Excel file into SPSS and to understand how data for an experimental design is typically structured.

### Part A: Creating the Source Data in Excel

In the real world, you rarely enter data manually into SPSS. More often, you'll collect it using survey tools that export to formats like CSV or Excel. Let's simulate this.

1.  Open a spreadsheet program (like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc).
2.  Create a new blank sheet.
3.  **Crucial Step:** In the very first row (Row 1), enter your variable names. In the rows below, enter the corresponding data. Replicate this table exactly:

| | A | B | C |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1**| Participant_ID | Study_Group | Quiz_Score |
| **2**| 1 | 1 | 18 |
| **3**| 2 | 1 | 16 |
| **4**| 3 | 1 | 19 |
| **5**| 4 | 1 | 17 |
| **6**| 5 | 1 | 15 |
| **7**| 6 | 2 | 12 |
| **8**| 7 | 2 | 14 |
| **9**| 8 | 2 | 11 |
| **10**| 9 | 2 | 15 |
| **11**| 10 | 2 | 13 |

* For `Study_Group`, `1` represents a "Classical Music" group and `2` represents a "No Music" control group.
* `Quiz_Score` is the score out of 20.

4.  Save this file on your computer as **`StudyData.xlsx`**.

### Part B: Importing the Excel File into SPSS

Now we'll bring that data into our statistics software.

1.  Open SPSS.
2.  Go to the main menu: **File -> Open -> Data...**
3.  An 'Open Data' dialog box will appear. At the bottom, there is a dropdown menu called **'Files of type:'**. Click it and change the selection from "SPSS Statistics (*.sav)" to **"Excel (*.xls, *.xlsx, *.xlsm)"**.
4.  Navigate to where you saved your `StudyData.xlsx` file and select it. Click **Open**.
5.  A new window called "Opening Excel Data Source" will appear. There is a very important checkbox at the top: **"Read variable names from the first row of data."** Make sure this is checked. This tells SPSS to use Row 1 from our spreadsheet as the variable names.
6.  Click **OK**.

### Part C: Verifying and Defining the Data

Your data should now be visible in the SPSS Data Editor, but we need to define it properly.

1.  Click on the **Variable View** tab at the bottom.
2.  Clean up the variables just as you did in Lab 2:
* For `Study_Group`:
  * **Label:** `Experimental Condition`
  * **Values:** Click the `...` button and define the values: `1` = "Classical Music", `2` = "No Music".
  * **Measure:** `Nominal`
* For `Quiz_Score`:
  * **Label:** `Score on Memory Quiz`
  * **Measure:** `Scale`
3.  **Note the Structure:** Look at your data in the Data View. You have one column that identifies which group a participant belongs to (the IV) and another column that contains their score (the DV). This is a standard way to structure data for experimental designs in SPSS.
4.  **Save Your Work:** Go to **File -> Save As...** and save the file as **`Week4_Lab.sav`**.
