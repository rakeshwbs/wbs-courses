## **Week 4: Your Research Blueprint (Research Design)**

The **research design** is the framework of methods and techniques chosen by a researcher to combine various components of research in a reasonably logical manner so that the research problem is handled efficiently. Your choice of design is dictated by your research question.

### **1. Experimental Designs: Testing for Cause-and-Effect**

If your research question involves testing a cause-and-effect relationship (e.g., "Does X *cause* Y?"), you'll need an experimental design.

#### **a) True Experimental Design**
This is the gold standard for establishing causality. It's like a classic laboratory experiment. ðŸ§ª
* **Purpose:** To determine if an independent variable (IV) causes a change in a dependent variable (DV).
* **Key Features:**
  1.  **Manipulation:** The researcher actively manipulates the IV (e.g., gives one group a new drug and the other a placebo).
  2.  **Control Group:** A group that does not receive the treatment, serving as a baseline for comparison.
  3.  **Random Assignment:** Participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. This is the most critical feature, as it minimizes bias and ensures the groups are comparable before the experiment begins.
* **Example:** To test a new fertilizer, a farmer divides a field into 20 plots. 10 plots are *randomly chosen* to receive the new fertilizer (experimental group), while the other 10 receive the standard fertilizer (control group). The crop yield (DV) is then compared.

#### **b) Quasi-Experimental Design**
This design is used when a true experiment is not feasible or ethical.
* **Purpose:** To estimate a cause-and-effect relationship.
* **Key Difference:** It involves manipulation of the IV but **lacks random assignment**.
* **Example:** A school district implements an anti-bullying program in one school (School A) but not in a neighboring one (School B). The researcher compares bullying incidents before and after the program. Because students were not randomly assigned to the schools, we can only make a cautious claim about causality. School A and B might have been different to begin with.

### **2. Non-Experimental Designs: Observing and Describing**

If your question is about describing a situation or exploring relationships as they naturally occur, you'll use a non-experimental design. Here, the researcher is a passive observer who measures variables without manipulating them.

#### **a) Survey Research**
* **Purpose:** To gather data on the attitudes, opinions, behaviors, or characteristics of a large group of people.
* **Method:** Uses questionnaires or structured interviews to collect data from a sample of a population.
* **Example:** A political poll asking 1,000 likely voters who they plan to vote for.

#### **b) Correlational Research**
* **Purpose:** To determine the existence and strength of a relationship between two or more variables.
* **Key Point:** This design can tell you if two variables move together, but it **cannot prove that one causes the other**.
* **Example:** A researcher finds that ice cream sales are positively correlated with crime rates. This doesn't mean eating ice cream causes crime. A third variable, hot weather, likely causes an increase in both.

#### **c) Case Study**
* **Purpose:** To conduct an in-depth, detailed investigation of a single subject (a person, a business, an event).
* **Benefit:** Provides rich, deep understanding.
* **Drawback:** Findings are not generalizable to a larger population.
* **Example:** A detailed study of how Apple Inc. managed its supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic.
