## Lab 8: Exploring Data with Descriptives and Charts

### Objective
To learn how to generate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) and create basic charts (histograms and bar charts) in SPSS.

### Part A: The Data
For this lab, we'll use the data file we created last week, which includes the `Age`, `Total_Satisfaction`, and `Age_Group` variables.

**Action:** Please open your `Week7_Lab.sav` file.

### Part B: Describing Continuous (Scale) Data

Let's start by getting a statistical summary and a histogram for our two continuous variables: `Age` and `Total_Satisfaction`.

1.  From the SPSS menu, go to: **Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Frequencies...**
2.  Move the two **Scale** variables, `Age` and `Total_Satisfaction`, from the left box into the right 'Variable(s)' box.
3.  **Uncheck** the box at the bottom that says **"Display frequency tables."** For continuous data, these tables are long and not very useful.
4.  Click the **Statistics...** button on the right.
* Check the boxes for **Mean, Median, Mode, Std. deviation,** and **Range**.
* Click **Continue**.
5.  Click the **Charts...** button on the right.
* Select **Histograms**.
* Check the box for **"Show normal curve on histogram."**
* Click **Continue**.
6.  Click **OK** to run the analysis.

#### Interpreting the Output
In the Output window, you will now have a neat "Statistics" table showing the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for both variables. You'll also see two histograms that visually represent the distribution of ages and satisfaction scores in your sample.

### Part C: Describing Categorical (Nominal/Ordinal) Data

Now let's analyze our categorical variable, `Age_Group`, to see how many people fall into each category.

1.  From the SPSS menu, go to: **Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Frequencies...**
2.  Click the **Reset** button at the bottom to clear the previous settings.
3.  Move the categorical variable, `Age_Group`, into the 'Variable(s)' box.
4.  **Make sure** the box at the bottom for **"Display frequency tables"** is **checked** this time. This is exactly what we want for categorical data.
5.  Click the **Charts...** button.
* Select **Bar charts**.
* Click **Continue**.
6.  Click **OK**.

#### Interpreting the Output
You will now see a frequency table showing the exact count ("Frequency") and percentage ("Percent") of participants in each age group. Below the table, a simple bar chart will visually represent these counts, making it easy to see which group is the largest.
