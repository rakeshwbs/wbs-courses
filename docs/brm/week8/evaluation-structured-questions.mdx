### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 8 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Define the three main measures of central tendency: **Mean, Median, and Mode**.
[12]

**Answer:**

1. **Mean:** The arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the total number of values.
2. **Median:** The middle value in a dataset that has been arranged in order from smallest to largest. It separates the lower half of the data from the upper half.
3. **Mode:** The value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For a correct definition of the Mean.
* [4 Marks] - For a correct definition of the Median.
* [4 Marks] - For a correct definition of the Mode.

(b) You are given the following dataset representing the ages of 7 employees on a team: `{22, 24, 25, 25, 28, 32, 65}`.

1. Calculate the **Mean** age.
2. Identify the **Median** age.
3. Identify the **Mode** age.
4. Which measure of central tendency is the most misleading for describing the "typical" age of an employee on this team, and why?

**Answer:**

1. **Mean:** (22 + 24 + 25 + 25 + 28 + 32 + 65) / 7 = 221 / 7 = **31.57 years**.
2. **Median:** The data is already in order. The middle value (4th value) is **25 years**.
3. **Mode:** The value that appears most often is **25 years**.
4. **Most Misleading Measure:** The **Mean** is the most misleading in this case because the dataset contains an **outlier** (65), which is much higher than the other values. This outlier pulls the mean upward, making the average age seem higher than the age of a "typical" employee, most of whom are in their 20s. The median (25) is a better representation.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For correctly calculating the Mean.
* [2 Marks] - For correctly identifying the Median.
* [2 Marks] - For correctly identifying the Mode.
* [2 Marks] - For identifying the Mean as the most misleading measure.
* [4 Marks] - For clearly explaining the impact of the outlier.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Explain what the **Standard Deviation** of a dataset represents. Then, explain the difference in interpretation between a dataset with a *low* standard deviation and a dataset with a *high* standard deviation.
[10]

**Answer:**

**Standard Deviation** represents the average amount of variability or dispersion in a dataset. It measures the average distance of each data point from the mean.

* **Low Standard Deviation:** Indicates that the data points are close to the mean, showing low variability. Values are consistent. Example: If the average exam score is 85% with a low SD, most students scored close to 85%.
* **High Standard Deviation:** Indicates that the data points are spread out over a wide range, showing high variability. Example: If the average exam score is 85% with a high SD, scores varied greatly (some high, some low).

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For defining standard deviation as the average spread from the mean.
* [3 Marks] - For explaining low SD interpretation.
* [3 Marks] - For explaining high SD interpretation.

(b) A researcher wants to visualize data from a recent employee survey. For each of the following scenarios, state which type of chart (**Histogram** or **Bar Chart**) would be more appropriate and briefly explain why.
[15]

1. To show the distribution of employee annual salaries in dollars (a continuous variable).
2. To compare the number of employees across five different company departments.
3. To see the frequency of different satisfaction ratings: 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

1. **Histogram** – Suitable for continuous data like salary, showing how values are distributed across ranges (bins).
2. **Bar Chart** – Suitable for comparing discrete categories such as departments.
3. **Bar Chart** – Suitable for showing frequencies of categorical (ordinal) data like satisfaction ratings.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - Correctly identifying Histogram for continuous data and explaining why.
* [5 Marks] - Correctly identifying Bar Chart for comparing categories and explaining why.
* [5 Marks] - Correctly identifying Bar Chart for ordinal satisfaction ratings and explaining why.
