## Lab 5: From Questionnaire to SPSS Data

### Objective
To practice coding questionnaire responses and entering them into SPSS, creating a complete data file from scratch.

### Part A: The Sample Questionnaire

Imagine you've handed out the following short survey to employees and received six completed copies back.



* **Respondent ID:** \_\_\_\_\_
* **Q1: What is your current age?** \_\_\_\_\_ (years)
* **Q2: What is your primary department?**
  * `O` Marketing
  * `O` Sales
  * `O` Human Resources
  * `O` IT
* **Q3: Please rate your agreement with the statement: "I am satisfied with our new company software."**
  * `O` Strongly Disagree `O` Disagree `O` Neutral `O` Agree `O` Strongly Agree

### Part B: Creating a "Codebook"

Before touching SPSS, a good researcher creates a **codebook**. This is a guide that translates the text/check-box answers into numbers that SPSS can work with.

Here is the codebook for our survey:

* **Respondent ID:**
  * Variable Name: `ID`
  * Measure: `Scale`
* **Q1 (Age):**
  * Variable Name: `Age`
  * Measure: `Scale`
* **Q2 (Department):**
  * Variable Name: `Department`
  * Coding: `1` = Marketing, `2` = Sales, `3` = Human Resources, `4` = IT
  * Measure: `Nominal`
* **Q3 (Satisfaction):**
  * Variable Name: `Satisfaction`
  * Coding: `1` = Strongly Disagree, `2` = Disagree, `3` = Neutral, `4` = Agree, `5` = Strongly Agree
  * Measure: `Ordinal`

### Part C: Data Entry in SPSS

Here are the six completed surveys you need to enter:

| ID | Age | Department      | Satisfaction      |
|:--:|:---:|:----------------|:------------------|
| 1  | 34  | Sales           | Agree             |
| 2  | 28  | Marketing       | Strongly Agree    |
| 3  | 45  | IT              | Disagree          |
| 4  | 52  | Human Resources | Agree             |
| 5  | 29  | Sales           | Neutral           |
| 6  | 41  | IT              | Strongly Disagree |

**Instructions:**

1.  **Open SPSS** and create a new, blank dataset.
2.  Go to the **Variable View** tab.
3.  Using your codebook from Part B, create and define the four variables (`ID`, `Age`, `Department`, `Satisfaction`).
* Set the correct **Name** and **Measure** for all variables.
* For `Department` and `Satisfaction`, you must enter the numeric codes and their corresponding text labels in the **Values** column.
4.  Once all variables are defined, click on the **Data View** tab.
5.  Enter the data from the "Completed Surveys" table above. Remember to use the **numeric codes** from your codebook (e.g., for Respondent 1, you will enter `2` for 'Sales' and `4` for 'Agree').
6.  **Check Your Work:** After entering all the data, go to the top menu and click **View -> Value Labels**. This will toggle the display in your data sheet between the numeric codes and the text labels. This is a great way to confirm you've set everything up correctly!
7.  **Save Your File:** Go to **File -> Save As...** and save the file as `Week5_Lab.sav`.
