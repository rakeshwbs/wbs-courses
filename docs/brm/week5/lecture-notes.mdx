## **Week 5: Gathering Your Evidence (Data Collection Methods)**

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest. The methods you choose are directly linked to your research design and whether you need numbers (quantitative) or stories (qualitative).

### **Primary vs. Secondary Data**

First, a key distinction:

* **Primary Data:** This is data you collect **yourself** for your specific research purpose. Itâ€™s fresh and tailored to your needs.
  * *Examples:* Data from a survey you create, interviews you conduct, or an experiment you run.
  * *Pro:* Directly answers your research question.
  * *Con:* Can be expensive and time-consuming to collect.
* **Secondary Data:** This is data that has **already been collected** by someone else for a different purpose.
  * *Examples:* Government census data, a company's past sales records, data from previously published academic studies.
  * *Pro:* Quick and often inexpensive to obtain.
  * *Con:* May not perfectly fit your research needs.

### **Quantitative Data Collection Methods**

These methods are used to collect **numerical data** that can be analyzed statistically.

#### **Surveys and Questionnaires**
This is the most common method for collecting quantitative data. It involves asking a group of people the same set of **closed-ended questions**.
* **Formats:** Multiple choice, yes/no questions, rating scales (e.g., "On a scale of 1 to 5...").
* **Administration:** Can be done online (e.g., Google Forms), by mail, over the phone, or in person.
* **Best for:** Describing the characteristics, opinions, or attitudes of a large population.

#### **Structured Observation**
This involves systematically observing and recording behavior according to a pre-defined coding sheet. The researcher is a neutral observer.
* **Example:** A traffic engineer counting the number of cars that turn left versus right at an intersection during rush hour.
* **Best for:** Collecting objective data on actual behaviors in a natural or controlled setting.

### **Qualitative Data Collection Methods**

These methods are used to collect **rich, non-numerical data** to understand experiences, contexts, and meanings.

#### **In-Depth Interviews**
These are one-on-one, semi-structured conversations where the researcher asks open-ended questions to explore a topic in detail.
* **Example:** A researcher spending an hour interviewing a startup founder about their experiences in building the company.
* **Best for:** Gaining deep, personal insights and understanding individual perspectives.

#### **Focus Groups**
A small group of carefully selected participants (usually 6-10) are brought together to discuss a specific topic under the guidance of a moderator. The interaction between participants is a key part of the data.
* **Example:** A food company gathering a group of parents to discuss their opinions on a new line of children's snacks.
* **Best for:** Exploring group norms, generating new ideas, and understanding shared opinions.

#### **Unstructured Observation (Ethnography)**
The researcher immerses themselves in a community or organization for an extended period to observe life as it happens. They take detailed field notes on behaviors, interactions, and culture.
* **Example:** An anthropologist living in a remote village for a year to understand its social structure.
* **Best for:** Gaining a holistic, "insider" understanding of a complex social setting.
