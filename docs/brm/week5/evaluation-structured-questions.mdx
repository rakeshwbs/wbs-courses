### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 5 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Differentiate between **Primary Data** and **Secondary Data**. Provide one clear business-related example for each and state a key advantage of using each type.
[12]

**Answer:**

**Primary Data** is original data collected firsthand by a researcher for their specific, current research purpose.
* **Example:** A company designing and sending out its own customer satisfaction survey to its email subscribers.
* **Key Advantage:** It is directly tailored to the researcher's specific needs and questions.

**Secondary Data** is data that has already been collected by someone else for a different purpose.
* **Example:** A market analyst using population data from a government census bureau to estimate market size.
* **Key Advantage:** It is generally much quicker and less expensive to obtain than primary data.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For a correct definition and example of Primary Data.
* [3 Marks] - For stating a key advantage of Primary Data.
* [3 Marks] - For a correct definition and example of Secondary Data.
* [3 Marks] - For stating a key advantage of Secondary Data.

(b) Compare and contrast **In-depth Interviews** and **Focus Groups** as qualitative data collection methods. You must address:

1. The number of participants involved in a typical session.
2. The key source of the data or insight in each method.
[13]

**Answer:**

**1. Number of Participants:**
* **In-depth Interview:** Involves only one participant at a time in a one-on-one setting with the researcher.
* **Focus Group:** Involves a small group of participants, typically between 6 and 10, discussing the topic together.

**2. Key Source of Data:**
* **In-depth Interview:** The key source of data is the rich, detailed personal perspective, experience, and narrative provided by the single individual without influence from others.
* **Focus Group:** While individual opinions are important, a key source of data is the **group interaction** itself. The way participants agree, disagree, and build on each other's comments provides unique insights into shared norms, language, and opinions.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For correctly stating the number of participants in an interview.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly stating the number of participants in a focus group.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying the source of data in an interview (individual perspective).
* [4 Marks] - For correctly identifying the source of data in a focus group, with specific mention of the group interaction.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A food production company wants to understand how families decide which snacks to buy for their children. They have hired you as a research consultant and are debating between using a quantitative survey or a qualitative focus group.

Advise the company on which method would be more suitable to start with. Justify your answer by explaining what type of insights each method would provide for this specific problem.
[12]

**Answer:**

**Advised Method:** They should start with a **qualitative focus group**.

**Justification:**
* **Focus Group Insights (Qualitative):** A focus group would allow the company to explore the "why" behind purchasing decisions. Parents could discuss their motivations, concerns about health, the influence of their children (pester power), and how they perceive packaging and branding. The group interaction could reveal shared cultural norms and unspoken rules about what constitutes a "good" snack. This provides deep, exploratory insights.
* **Survey Insights (Quantitative):** A survey would be better suited for collecting numerical data *after* the initial exploration. For example, once the focus group identifies "sugar content" as a key concern, a survey could be used to ask 500 parents to rate the importance of "low sugar" on a scale of 1 to 5. The survey measures "how many" people feel a certain way, but it doesn't explain *why* as deeply as a focus group does.

Starting with the focus group is better because it helps the company discover the important themes first, which can then be used to design a more effective and relevant quantitative survey later.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For clearly advising to start with a focus group.
* [4 Marks] - For explaining the rich, "why"-focused insights a focus group would provide in this context.
* [4 Marks] - For explaining the "how many"-focused, numerical insights a survey would provide.
* [1 Mark] - For correctly stating the logical flow (qualitative exploration first, then quantitative validation).

(b) You are creating a **codebook** to prepare survey data for entry into SPSS. Your survey has the following question:

* **Q5: How often do you use our mobile app?**
  * `O` Never
  * `O` Rarely (A few times a year)
  * `O` Sometimes (A few times a month)
  * `O` Frequently (A few times a week)

For this question, state the **Variable Name**, the **Coding** you would use, and the appropriate **Level of Measurement** in SPSS.
[13]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

* **Variable Name:** A suitable short name would be `App_Usage` or `Usage_Frequency`. (A simple `Usage` would also be acceptable).
* **Coding:** A logical numerical coding scheme would be:
  * `1` = Never
  * `2` = Rarely
  * `3` = Sometimes
  * `4` = Frequently
* **Level of Measurement:** The appropriate level of measurement in SPSS would be **Ordinal**. This is because the categories have a clear and meaningful rank order (Frequently is more than Sometimes), but the interval between "Never" and "Rarely" is not necessarily the same as the interval between "Sometimes" and "Frequently".

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For providing a suitable variable name.
* [5 Marks] - For providing a complete and logical coding scheme.
* [5 Marks] - For correctly identifying `Ordinal` as the level of measurement and providing a brief reason.
