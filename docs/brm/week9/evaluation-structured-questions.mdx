### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 9 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Explain the role of the **p-value** in hypothesis testing. In your answer, you must describe the decision rule for determining statistical significance using the standard alpha level of 0.05.

**Answer:**

The **p-value** is the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme results) from a sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value indicates that the observed data is very unlikely if there were no real effect.

**The Decision Rule:**
Compare the p-value to the significance level (alpha, α = 0.05):
* If **p ≤ 0.05**, **reject the null hypothesis**. The result is statistically significant, meaning there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
* If **p > 0.05**, **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. The result is not statistically significant, meaning there is insufficient evidence to claim a real effect.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For a clear definition of the p-value.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly stating the "p ≤ 0.05" rule and outcome.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly stating the "p > 0.05" rule and outcome.

(b) For each of the following research questions, identify the most appropriate statistical test from this list: **Independent-Samples t-Test, Paired-Samples t-Test, or Chi-Square Test of Independence.**
[15]

1. "Is there an association between a student's faculty (Arts vs. Science) and their preferred study method (Alone vs. Group)?"
2. "Do employees show a higher job satisfaction score *after* a company retreat compared to their score *before* the retreat?"
3. "Is there a difference in the average sales figures between stores managed by male managers and stores managed by female managers?"
4. "Is there a relationship between a person's smoking status (Smoker vs. Non-smoker) and whether they have been diagnosed with a specific respiratory illness (Yes vs. No)?"
5. "Are the average response times for Customer Service Team A different from the average response times for Customer Service Team B?"

**Answer:**

1. **Chi-Square Test of Independence** – two categorical variables.
2. **Paired-Samples t-Test** – one group measured twice.
3. **Independent-Samples t-Test** – comparing means of two independent groups.
4. **Chi-Square Test of Independence** – two categorical variables.
5. **Independent-Samples t-Test** – comparing means of two independent groups.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For each correct identification (Total 15 marks).

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

A researcher conducts an **Independent-Samples t-Test** to compare the mean exam scores of two groups: a 'Standard Study' group and a 'New Method' group.

**SPSS Output:**

| Group           | N  | Mean   | Std. Deviation |
|-----------------|----|--------|----------------|
| Standard Study  | 30 | 75.20  | 8.50           |
| New Method      | 30 | 82.50  | 9.10           |

**Independent Samples Test Table**
t = -3.150, df = 58, **Sig. (2-tailed) = .003**

(a) State the null hypothesis ($H_0$) for this study.
[5]
(b) What is the p-value for this test? Is the result statistically significant? Explain your decision.
[10]
(c) Write a single sentence that summarizes the conclusion of this study, including the means of both groups and the p-value.
[10]

**Answer:**

**(a) Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is no significant difference in the mean exam scores between the 'Standard Study' group and the 'New Method' group.

**(b) p-value and Significance:**
* **p-value:** .003 (from "Sig. (2-tailed)").
* **Significance:** Yes, statistically significant.
* **Decision:** Since .003 ≤ 0.05, reject $H_0$.

**(c) Conclusion Sentence:**
An independent-samples t-test showed that the 'New Method' group had significantly higher exam scores (M = 82.50) than the 'Standard Study' group (M = 75.20), p = .003.

**Marking Scheme:**
* (a) [5 Marks] - For a clear, correct null hypothesis.
* (b) [10 Marks] - 3 marks for p-value, 3 marks for stating significance, 4 marks for decision rule.
* (c) [10 Marks] - Includes means of both groups, correct test, and exact p-value.
