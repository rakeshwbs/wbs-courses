### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 10 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Explain the primary purpose of a **One-Way ANOVA**. In your answer, explain why it is statistically preferable to running multiple t-tests when comparing three or more groups.

**Answer:**

The primary purpose of a **One-Way ANOVA** is to test for a statistically significant difference between the **means** of **three or more independent groups**.

It is preferable to multiple t-tests because running multiple t-tests increases the risk of **Type I error** (false positives). Each t-test has about a 5% chance of producing a false positive; doing many tests compounds this error rate. ANOVA uses a single test to assess overall differences, keeping the error rate at the chosen alpha level (e.g., 5%).

**Marking Scheme:**
* [4 Marks] - For a clear definition of ANOVA’s purpose (comparing means of 3+ groups).
* [3 Marks] - For identifying the Type I error inflation with multiple t-tests.
* [3 Marks] - For explaining that ANOVA controls the error rate with a single test.

(b) A researcher conducts a One-Way ANOVA to test if there is a difference in 'Customer Satisfaction' scores across three 'Store Layouts' (A, B, C). They get the following SPSS output:

* **ANOVA Table:** F = 7.95, **Sig. = .001**
* **Post-Hoc Tests (Tukey HSD):**
  * Layout A vs B: **p = .850**
  * Layout A vs C: **p = .002**
  * Layout B vs C: **p = .004**

Based on this output:

1. Is there a significant difference among the groups? Explain how you know.
2. Which specific groups are significantly different?

**Answer:**

**1. Overall Difference:**
Yes. The main ANOVA p-value (**.001**) is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis.

**2. Specific Group Differences:**
* Layout A vs B (p = .850) → **Not significant**.
* Layout A vs C (p = .002) → **Significant**.
* Layout B vs C (p = .004) → **Significant**.

Thus, Layout C differs significantly from both Layout A and Layout B; Layouts A and B do not differ significantly.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - Correctly states overall significance.
* [4 Marks] - Justifies decision using main ANOVA p-value.
* [4 Marks] - Identifies A vs C and B vs C as significant.
* [4 Marks] - Identifies A vs B as not significant.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

A researcher examines whether 'Years of Experience' predicts 'Annual Salary' (in thousands). They run a simple linear regression with these results:

* **Model Summary:** R² = **.810**
* **ANOVA Table:** Sig. = **.001**
* **Coefficients:**
  * Constant = **45.0**
  * Years of Experience B = **3.5**, Sig. = **.001**

(a) Interpret the R² value. Is the model significant? How do you know?
[10]
(b) Write the regression equation. Predict salary for a manager with 10 years’ experience.
[10]
(c) Is 'Years of Experience' a significant predictor? Justify.
[5]

**Answer:**

**(a) R² and Model Significance:**
* R² = .810 → 81% of salary variance is explained by years of experience.
* Model is significant because ANOVA p-value = .001 < .05.

**(b) Regression Equation and Prediction:**
* Equation: Salary = 45.0 + (3.5 × Years of Experience)
* For 10 years: 45.0 + (3.5 × 10) = 80.0 → **$80,000** predicted.

**(c) Predictor Significance:**
Yes. The coefficient p-value = .001 < .05, so it is significant.

**Marking Scheme:**
* (a) [10 Marks] - 5 for R² interpretation, 5 for model significance.
* (b) [10 Marks] - 5 for correct equation, 5 for correct prediction.
* (c) [5 Marks] - 2 for “Yes”, 3 for p-value justification.
