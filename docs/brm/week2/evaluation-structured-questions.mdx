### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 2 Concepts**

**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Differentiate between a **conceptual definition** and an **operational definition**. Provide an example of each for the business construct "Brand Image".
[10]

**Answer:**

A **conceptual definition** defines a construct in abstract, theoretical terms. It's the "dictionary definition" that explains what the concept means.
* *Example:* The **conceptual definition** of "Brand Image" is the overall perception, feeling, and set of beliefs a consumer holds about a particular brand.

An **operational definition** defines a construct by specifying the exact procedures or operations used to measure it. It makes the abstract concept concrete and measurable.
* *Example:* The **operational definition** of "Brand Image" could be the average score from a 1-to-7 survey where consumers rate the brand on three dimensions: "innovative," "trustworthy," and "high quality."

The key difference is that the conceptual definition explains *what* you are studying, while the operational definition explains *how* you will measure it.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [2 Marks] - Correctly defines a conceptual definition.
* [2 Marks] - Correctly defines an operational definition.
* [2 Marks] - Clearly articulates the core difference (what vs. how).
* [2 Marks] - Provides a suitable conceptual definition for "Brand Image".
* [2 Marks] - Provides a suitable and measurable operational definition for "Brand Image".

(b) Define and provide a clear business-related example for an **Independent Variable (IV)** and a **Dependent Variable (DV)**.

**Answer:**

An **Independent Variable (IV)** is the variable that is manipulated or changed by the researcher and is presumed to be the **cause** of a change in another variable.
* *Example:* In a study to see if the color of a "Buy Now" button affects clicks, the **button color** (e.g., red vs. green) is the IV.

A **Dependent Variable (DV)** is the variable that is measured by the researcher to see the effect of the IV. It is the presumed **effect**.
* *Example:* In the same study, the **number of clicks** on the button is the DV, as it is expected to 'depend' on the button's color.

A **Control Variable** is a variable that is kept constant or statistically accounted for to prevent it from influencing the relationship between the IV and DV.
* *Example:* In the button study, the **price of the product** shown on the page would be a control variable, kept the same for both button colors to ensure it's not the reason for a difference in clicks.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For a correct definition and example of an IV.
* [3 Marks] - For a correct definition and example of a DV.
* [3 Marks] - For a correct definition and example of a Control Variable.

(c) In SPSS, what are the three main "Levels of Measurement" available in the Variable View? Briefly describe each one.

**Answer:**

The three main levels of measurement in SPSS are:

1. **Nominal:** Used for categorical data where there is no intrinsic order or ranking between the categories. (e.g., `City of Residence`, `Gender`).
2. **Ordinal:** Used for categorical data that has a meaningful order or rank, but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal. (e.g., `Customer Satisfaction` ranked 'Low', 'Medium', 'High').
3. **Scale:** Used for continuous numeric data where the intervals between values are equal and meaningful. It combines both interval and ratio data. (e.g., `Age in Years`, `Temperature`, `Income`).

**Marking Scheme:**
* [2 Marks] - Correctly identifies and describes Nominal.
* [2 Marks] - Correctly identifies and describes Ordinal.
* [2 Marks] - Correctly identifies and describes Scale.

**QUESTION 2 [25 MARKS]**

(a) A human resources manager theorizes the following: "Introducing a new employee wellness program (IV) will lead to lower stress levels, which in turn will cause a decrease in employee absenteeism (DV)."

1. Identify the **mediating variable** in this scenario and explain its role in the causal chain. [6]
2. An analyst suggests that the program's effect on stress might be much stronger for employees in junior roles than for senior management. In this new context, what type of variable is "Employee Role" (Junior vs. Senior)? Explain your reasoning. [6]

[12]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Mediating Variable:**
* **Mediating Variable:** `Lower Stress Levels`.
* **Explanation:** The mediating variable explains the *process* or *mechanism* through which the IV affects the DV. It's the "how". The wellness program doesn't directly cause people to miss less work; it does so *by* reducing their stress. The causal path is: Wellness Program → Lower Stress → Lower Absenteeism.

**2. Employee Role as a Variable:**
* **Variable Type:** `Moderating Variable`.
* **Explanation:** "Employee Role" is a moderating variable because it changes the *strength* of the relationship between the wellness program (IV) and stress levels. It doesn't explain the process, but rather specifies a condition under which the effect is stronger or weaker. It acts like a volume knob on the relationship.

**Marking Scheme:**
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying "Lower Stress Levels" as the mediator.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly explaining the role of a mediator (process/mechanism/how).
* [3 Marks] - For correctly identifying "Employee Role" as a moderator.
* [3 Marks] - For correctly explaining the role of a moderator (changes strength/specifies condition).

(b) You are tasked with designing a study to investigate the relationship between the "perceived security of a website" and a user's "willingness to make a purchase".

1. Provide a clear **conceptual definition** for the construct "Perceived Security". [5]
2. Provide a clear and measurable **operational definition** for the same construct. [8]

[13]

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

**Answer:**

**1. Conceptual DefinitionBox:**
"Perceived Security" is the subjective judgment and feeling of confidence a user has that their personal and financial information will be protected from unauthorized access or use during and after a transaction on a website.

**2. Operational DefinitionBox:**
"Perceived Security" will be measured by calculating the average score from a user survey administered after they browse the website. The survey will consist of three questions answered on a 7-point Likert scale (where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 7 = Strongly Agree):
* Q1: "I feel that my personal information is safe on this website."
* Q2: "This website has adequate measures to protect my financial data."
* Q3: "I trust this website to handle my transaction securely."

**Marking Scheme:**
* [5 Marks] - For a clear conceptual definition that captures the abstract idea of a user's judgment and feeling of safety.
* [4 Marks] - For proposing a clear method of measurement (e.g., a survey).
* [4 Marks] - For providing specific, measurable items/questions that logically represent the construct.
