## Week 1: Foundations of Algorithms & C++

Welcome to your first week of Data Structures & Algorithms!
This week, we'll build the essential foundation upon which everything else will rest.
We'll cover the "what" and "why" of algorithms and refresh the core C++ tools we'll need.

### **Algorithm**
:::info DEFINITION
An **algorithm** is a well-defined, step-by-step procedure for solving a specific problem or accomplishing a specific task.
:::
Think of it as a recipe. It has a list of ingredients (inputs), a clear set of instructions to follow in order,
and it results in a finished dish (output).

Key characteristics of a good algorithm:

| **Property**      | **Description**                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**         | It has zero or more well-defined inputs.                                                                            |
| **Output**        | It produces at least one well-defined output.                                                                       |
| **Finiteness**    | It must terminate after a finite number of steps.                                                                   |
| **Unambiguity**   | Each step must be clear, precise, and have only one interpretation.                                                 |
| **Effectiveness** | Each step must be basic enough that it can be carried out, in principle, by a person using only a pencil and paper. |

We often use **pseudocode** to sketch out algorithms. It's a simplified, language-agnostic way to describe the steps without worrying about the strict syntax of C++.

### **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**
:::info DEFINITION
An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a theoretical model that defines a set of data values and a set of operations on that data. It answers **what** a data type can do, but not **how** it does it.
:::

* **Analogy:**
Think of the dashboard of a car.  You have a steering wheel, an accelerator, and a brake pedal (the operations). You know *what* they do (turn the car, speed up, slow down), but you don't need to know the underlying mechanical or electronic systems (*how* they are implemented) to drive the car. The dashboard is the interface; the engine is the implementation.
* In this course, `List`, `Stack`, and `Queue` are ADTs. We'll define their operations first and then implement them using C++.
---
### **Essential C++ Review ⚙️**
To build our data structures, we need a firm grasp on a few C++ features:

* **Pointers:** A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. They are the backbone of dynamic data structures like linked lists. We use the `&` (address-of) operator to get a variable's address and the `*` (dereference) operator to access the value at that address.

* **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Often, we don't know how much data we need to store when we write the program. C++ allows us to request memory from the operating system at runtime from a memory pool called the **heap**.
  * `new`: The `new` keyword allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to it.
  * `delete`: The `delete` keyword frees the memory allocated with `new`, returning it to the system. Forgetting to `delete` memory causes a **memory leak**.

* **Classes vs. Structs:**
  * Both are user-defined types that can bundle data and functions together.
  * The key difference in C++: In a `class`, members are **private** by default. In a `struct`, members are **public** by default.
  * **Our Convention:** We will use `class` for our ADT implementations to enforce **encapsulation**—bundling data and the methods that operate on that data, while hiding the internal details.
