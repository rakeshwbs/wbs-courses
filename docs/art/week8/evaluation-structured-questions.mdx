## **QUESTION 1 \[25 MARKS]**

**(a)** OSPF relies on different Link-State Advertisement (LSA) types to build its topological database. Match the LSA Type from Column A with its correct description in Column B.

| Column A (LSA Type)  | Column B (Description)                                                         |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Type 1 (Router)   | i. Generated by an ASBR to advertise external routes into the OSPF domain.     |
| 2. Type 3 (Summary)  | ii. Generated by every router to describe its own links within its local area. |
| 3. Type 5 (External) | iii. Generated by an ABR to advertise routes from one area to another.         |

    **Answer:**

    * **1. Type 1 (Router)** → **ii. Generated by every router to describe its own links within its local area.**
    * **2. Type 3 (Summary)** → **iii. Generated by an ABR to advertise routes from one area to another.**
    * **3. Type 5 (External)** → **i. Generated by an ASBR to advertise external routes into the OSPF domain.**

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For each correct match.

**(b)** An administrator decides to optimise a remote office network, which is configured as OSPF Area 5. This area has only one connection to the rest of the network via its ABR.

i. To reduce the routing table size on the routers within Area 5, the administrator converts it to a standard stub area. What single command must be configured on **every router** within Area 5 to achieve this? \[2]
ii. After the configuration is applied, what specific change will the administrator see in the routing tables of the Area 5 routers regarding routes external to the OSPF domain? \[4]

<details>

    **Answer:**

    i. The required command is:

    ```
    area 5 stub
    ```

    This must be entered under the `router ospf [process-id]` configuration on all routers in Area 5.

    ii. All specific external routes (those previously marked as `O E1` or `O E2`) will be removed from the routing table and replaced by a single default route (`O*IA 0.0.0.0/0`) automatically injected by the ABR.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[2 Marks] – For the correct `area 5 stub` command.
    * \[2 Marks] – For stating that specific external routes are removed.
    * \[2 Marks] – For stating they are replaced by a default route injected by the ABR.

**(c)** An Area Border Router (ABR) connects OSPF Area 20 to the backbone. Area 20 contains the following four networks:

* `172.20.8.0/24`
* `172.20.9.0/24`
* `172.20.10.0/24`
* `172.20.11.0/24`

i. Determine the single most efficient summary address that encompasses all four networks. Show the address and the correct subnet mask. \[3]
ii. Write the exact command that would be configured on the ABR to advertise this summary to the backbone area. \[3]

<details>

    **Answer:**

    i. Summary route:
    `172.20.8.0 255.255.252.0` (or `/22`)
    Binary check: The networks range from `172.20.00001000.0` to `172.20.00001011.0`. The first 22 bits are common.

    ii. ABR configuration:

    ```
    area 20 range 172.20.8.0 255.255.252.0
    ```

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[3 Marks] – For the correct summary address and mask.
    * \[3 Marks] – For the correct `area range` command syntax.

**(d)** Explain the key functional difference between a standard OSPF **Stub Area** and a **Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)**. Provide a brief network scenario where an NSSA would be necessary. \[6]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    * **Key Difference:**
    A **Stub Area** cannot contain an Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) and blocks all Type 5 LSAs from entering the area.
    An **NSSA** is similar to a stub area but can contain an ASBR. It blocks Type 5 LSAs from the backbone but allows its internal ASBR to inject external routes into OSPF using Type 7 LSAs.

    * **Scenario:**
    A branch office is connected to the corporate backbone (and should be a stub to reduce routing overhead) but also connects directly to a partner’s external network. The branch router acting as ASBR must redistribute the partner’s routes into OSPF, which is only possible if the area is configured as an NSSA.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * \[3 Marks] – For clearly explaining the functional difference (NSSA allows ASBR and uses Type 7 LSAs).
    * \[3 Marks] – For a relevant scenario demonstrating when NSSA is needed.
