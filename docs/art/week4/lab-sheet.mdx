# Week 4 Lab: RIPv2 and Introduction to EIGRP

## Objective

This lab is split into two parts. In Part 1, you will experience a classic network failure caused by RIPv1's classful nature and then fix it by migrating to the classless RIPv2. In Part 2, you will replace RIP entirely with a basic EIGRP configuration, observing its different verification commands and behavior.

## Required Software

- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Network Topology

We will use the same three-router topology from Week 3, but with a different IP addressing scheme designed to highlight classful vs. classless behavior. This is a **discontiguous network**.

```text
      (Lo0: 172.16.1.1/24)              (No LAN)                  (Lo0: 172.16.2.1/24)

## Part 1: Migrating from RIPv1 to RIPv2

### Task 1: Build and Configure the Base Topology

1. Build the three-router topology above. Configure all physical and loopback interfaces with the specified IP addresses.
2. Do not configure any routing yet.

### Task 2: Configure RIPv1 and Observe the Failure

1. On **all three routers**, configure basic RIPv1.

* On **Router-A**: `router rip`, `network 172.16.0.0`, `network 10.0.0.0`
* On **Router-B**: `router rip`, `network 10.0.0.0`
* On **Router-C**: `router rip`, `network 172.16.0.0`, `network 10.0.0.0`
2. Wait about a minute for RIP to converge.
3. On **Router-A**, check the routing table: `show ip route`.
4. **Analysis:** You will see a route for `172.16.0.0/16` pointing towards Router-B, but you will **not** see a specific route for Router-C's LAN (`172.16.2.0/24`). A ping from Router-A's loopback (`ping 172.16.2.1 source Lo0`) will fail. This is because RIPv1 auto-summarizes the `172.16.0.0` networks at the major `10.0.0.0` network boundary.

### Task 3: Upgrade to RIPv2 and Verify the Fix

1. On **all three routers**, upgrade your RIP configuration to version 2 and disable auto-summary.

```bash
configure terminal
router rip
version 2
no auto-summary
   ```
2. Wait another minute for the new updates to be exchanged.
3. On **Router-A**, check the routing table again: `show ip route`.
4. **Analysis:** You should now see the specific route `R 172.16.2.0/24 [120/2] via 10.1.12.2...`. The classless RIPv2 sends the subnet mask in its updates, allowing it to correctly handle this discontiguous design. A ping from Router-A's loopback to Router-C's loopback will now succeed.

---

## Part 2: Basic EIGRP Configuration

Now, we will replace RIP with a superior protocol.

### Task 4: Remove the RIP Configuration

1. On **all three routers**, enter global configuration mode and remove the entire RIP process.

```bash
configure terminal
no router rip
```
2. Verify that all 'R' routes disappear from the routing table with `show ip route`.

### Task 5: Configure EIGRP

We will use Autonomous System (AS) number **100**. This number must be the same on all routers for them to become neighbors.

1. On **Router-A**, configure EIGRP. Note the use of **wildcard masks** (the inverse of a subnet mask).

```bash
router eigrp 100
network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255
network 10.1.12.0 0.0.0.3
```
2. On **Router-B**, configure EIGRP.

```bash
router eigrp 100
network 10.1.12.0 0.0.0.3
network 10.1.23.0 0.0.0.3
```
3. On **Router-C**, configure EIGRP.

```bash
router eigrp 100
network 172.16.2.0 0.0.0.255
network 10.1.23.0 0.0.0.3
```

### Task 6: Verify EIGRP Operation

1. As you configure the routers, you will see console messages about new adjacencies being formed. This is the Hello protocol at work.
2. On **Router-B**, use the primary EIGRP verification command to see its neighbors.

```bash
show ip eigrp neighbors
```

You should see entries for Router-A (`10.1.12.1`) and Router-C (`10.1.23.2`).
3. On **Router-A**, check the routing table: `show ip route`.
4. **Analysis:** You will now see routes marked with a **'D'** (for DUAL). Notice that the administrative distance is `90`, and the metric is a very large number. This is the composite metric.
5. Confirm full connectivity by pinging from Router-A's loopback to Router-C's loopback.

## Exploration Questions

1. In Part 1, why exactly did RIPv1 fail to advertise the `172.16.2.0/24` route from Router-C to Router-A? What is the name of the process that caused this?
2. Compare the output of `show ip route` for a route learned by RIP vs. EIGRP. What are the two most obvious differences in the `[AD/Metric]` portion of the entry?
3. What command did you use in Task 6 to verify that EIGRP routers had successfully formed neighbor relationships? What protocol do they use to form these relationships?
4. The EIGRP `network` command uses a wildcard mask (e.g., `0.0.0.3`). The subnet mask for that network was `255.255.255.252`. What is the mathematical relationship between a subnet mask and its corresponding wildcard mask?
