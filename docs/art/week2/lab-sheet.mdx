# Week 2 Lab: Implementing Static & Default Routes

## Objective

This lab directly continues from Week 1. You will solve the connectivity issue between the two LANs by implementing static routes. You will verify full connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute`, and examine the routing table to see the changes. Finally, you will explore a more scalable type of static route: the default route.

## Required Setup

-   The completed Cisco Packet Tracer topology from Week 1. If you did not save it, please rebuild it according to the Week 1 Labsheet.

## Network Topology (Reminder)

```text
       (LAN 1: EbÃ¨ne)                               (LAN 2: Port Louis)
                                  Serial DTE/DCE
      192.168.1.0/24                   Link                    192.168.2.0/24
                                 10.0.0.0/30
+------------+     +-----------+ S0/0/0      S0/0/0 +-----------+     +------------+
|    PC-A    |-----|  Switch-A |------------------| Router-B  |-----|  Switch-B  |-----|    PC-B    |
+------------+     +-----------+       R-A        +-----------+     +------------+     +------------+
   .10   g: .1       G0/0 .1                         G0/0 .1                           .10  g: .1
```

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Confirm the Problem

1.  Before making any changes, open the command prompt on **PC-A** and ping **PC-B**.

```bash
ping 192.168.2.10
    ```
The ping should fail, as it did at the end of Lab 1.
2.  On **Router-A**, view the routing table.
```bash
enable
show ip route
```
Confirm that there is no entry for the `192.168.2.0` network.

### Task 2: Configure Specific Static Routes

You will now manually add the routes to teach each router about the other's LAN.

1.  On **Router-A**, enter global configuration mode and add a static route to the Port Louis network (`192.168.2.0/24`). The next hop is Router-B's serial interface (`10.0.0.2`).
```bash
configure terminal
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
```
2.  On **Router-B**, enter global configuration mode and add a static route back to the EbÃ¨ne network (`192.168.1.0/24`). The next hop is Router-A's serial interface (`10.0.0.1`).
```bash
configure terminal
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
```

### Task 3: Verify End-to-End Connectivity

Now that the routes are in place, let's test if our solution worked.

1.  On **Router-A**, view the routing table again.
```bash
show ip route
```
You should now see a new line that starts with `S`. This is your static route! It should look like this: `S   192.168.2.0/24 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2`.
2.  On **PC-A**, repeat the ping to **PC-B**.
```bash
ping 192.168.2.10
```
The ping should now be SUCCESSFUL. You have achieved full end-to-end connectivity.
3.  From **PC-A**, use the `tracert` command to see the path the packet takes.
```bash
tracert 192.168.2.10
```
The output should show three hops:
-   Your gateway (Router-A: `192.168.1.1`)
-   The next router (Router-B: `10.0.0.2`)
-   The final destination (PC-B: `192.168.2.10`)

### Task 4 (Bonus): Re-configuring with Default Routes

A default route is a "catch-all" route used when a router doesn't have a specific route for a destination. It's often called a "quad-zero" route. Let's see it in action.

1.  First, remove the specific static routes you configured. Use the `no` form of the command.
-   On **Router-A**: `no ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`
-   On **Router-B**: `no ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1`
2.  Now, configure a default route on **Router-A** that sends any unknown traffic to Router-B.
```bash
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.2
```
3.  Configure a default route on **Router-B** that sends any unknown traffic to Router-A.
```bash
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1
```
4.  Verify connectivity again by pinging from PC-A to PC-B. It should still work.
5.  Check the routing table on Router-A with `show ip route`. You will now see a `S*` route, indicating a static default route candidate.

## Exploration Questions

1.  In the output of `show ip route` for your specific static route, you saw `[1/0]`. What do the '1' and the '0' represent? (Hint: Refer to the lecture notes on AD).
2.  What do you think would have happened if you configured the static route on Router-A but forgot to add the return route on Router-B? Would the first ping packet from PC-A even reach PC-B? Would the reply from PC-B ever make it back to PC-A? Explain your reasoning.
3.  Default routes are very powerful. In a real-world scenario where your company has one router connecting to the internet, would you use a default route or specific static routes to send traffic to web servers like google.com? Why?
