**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) Explain the fundamental difference between how a router makes a forwarding decision using traditional destination-based routing versus using Policy-Based Routing (PBR).
[6]

    **Answer:**

    - **Traditional Routing:** The router makes its forwarding decision based **only** on the **destination IP address** of a packet. It performs a lookup in its routing table to find the best, longest-match path to that destination and forwards the packet accordingly. It does not consider the source of the packet or the type of traffic.
    - **Policy-Based Routing (PBR):** The router makes a forwarding decision based on **a defined policy** before it consults the routing table. PBR uses tools like ACLs and route-maps to identify traffic based on other criteria (like source IP, protocol, or port number) and can force that specific traffic to take a different path, effectively overriding the main routing table.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of traditional destination-based routing.
    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of how PBR overrides the routing table based on other policy criteria.

(b) A company in Ebène is establishing its connection to the internet. Under which specific circumstance would this company need to use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) rather than simply using a static default route provided by their ISP?
[5]

    **Answer:**

    The company would need to use BGP if it is **multi-homed**, which means it has connections to **two or more different Internet Service Providers** (e.g., it has a fiber link from Mauritius Telecom and another fiber link from Emtel).

    BGP is necessary in this scenario to manage the redundant connections, receive route advertisements from both ISPs, make intelligent decisions about the best path for outbound traffic, and properly advertise its own public IP address block to the entire internet through both providers. A single-homed company (connected to only one ISP) would just use a static default route.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [2 Marks] - For correctly identifying the multi-homing scenario.
    * [3 Marks] - For explaining the benefits/necessity (redundancy, path selection, advertising own IPs).

(c) Compare and contrast eBGP and iBGP. In your answer, you must clearly state:
i. The primary purpose of each. [4]
ii. Their default Administrative Distance (AD) values and the significance of these values. [4]

<details>
    <summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

    **Answer:**

    i. **Primary Purpose:**
    - **eBGP (External BGP):** Its purpose is to form a peering session and exchange routing information **between different** Autonomous Systems (AS).
    - **iBGP (Internal BGP):** Its purpose is to exchange BGP routing information **within a single** Autonomous System, ensuring all routers in the AS have consistent external routing knowledge.

    ii. **Administrative Distance:**
    - **eBGP AD:** 20. This is a very low and trustworthy value, ensuring that a route learned directly from an external peer is almost always preferred.
    - **iBGP AD:** 200. This is a very high and untrustworthy value. This is significant because it ensures that for traffic destined for an internal network, the router will always prefer its IGP route (e.g., OSPF at 110 or EIGRP at 90) over a potentially looped-back iBGP route.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [2 Marks] - For the purpose of eBGP.
    * [2 Marks] - For the purpose of iBGP.
    * [2 Marks] - For the correct AD values for both.
    * [2 Marks] - For explaining the significance of the high iBGP AD value.

(d) You are on **Router-A** which is in **AS 65100**. You need to configure an eBGP peering session with an ISP router, **Router-B**, which is in **AS 65200**. The IP address of Router-B's interface is `198.51.100.2`. Write the full and exact commands required on **Router-A** to establish this eBGP session.
[6]

    **Answer:**

    The configuration requires starting the local BGP process and then defining the neighbor with its remote AS number.

    ```bash
    configure terminal
    router bgp 65100
    neighbor 198.51.100.2 remote-as 65200
    ```

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [2 Marks] - For `router bgp 65100`.
    * [4 Marks] - For the correct `neighbor` command, including the correct IP address and correct `remote-as` number.
