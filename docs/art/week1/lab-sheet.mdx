# Week 1 Lab: Basic Topology & Connectivity

## Objective

This lab is designed to refamiliarize you with the network simulation environment (Cisco Packet Tracer)
and reinforce your understanding of fundamental networking concepts.

You will build a simple two-network topology, configure IP addresses on end devices and routers, and use common verification commands to test connectivity.

The primary goal is to observe the boundary between a switched LAN and a routed WAN.

## Required Software

-   **Cisco Packet Tracer** (or GNS3/EVE-NG if you are familiar with them).

## Network Topology

You will build the following network.
This topology consists of two separate Local Area Networks (LANs), one for "Ebène" and one for "Port Louis," connected by two routers.

```text
       (LAN 1: Ebène)                               (LAN 2: Port Louis)
                                  Serial DTE/DCE
      192.168.1.0/24                   Link                    192.168.2.0/24
                                 10.0.0.0/30
+------------+     +-----------+ S0/0/0      S0/0/0 +-----------+     +------------+
|    PC-A    |-----|  Switch-A |------------------| Router-B  |-----|  Switch-B  |-----|    PC-B    |
+------------+     +-----------+       R-A        +-----------+     +------------+     +------------+
   .10   g: .1       G0/0 .1                         G0/0 .1                           .10  g: .1
```

### IP Addressing Scheme

| Device | Interface | IP Address | Subnet Mask | Default Gateway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PC-A** | NIC | `192.168.1.10` | `255.255.255.0` | `192.168.1.1` |
| **PC-B** | NIC | `192.168.2.10` | `255.255.255.0` | `192.168.2.1` |
| **Router-A** | G0/0 | `192.168.1.1` | `255.255.255.0` | N/A |
| | S0/0/0 | `10.0.0.1` | `255.255.255.252`| N/A |
| **Router-B** | G0/0 | `192.168.2.1` | `255.255.255.0` | N/A |
| | S0/0/0 | `10.0.0.2` | `255.255.255.252`| N/A |

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Build the Topology

1.  Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2.  Place the required devices onto the workspace: 2 PCs, 2 Switches (e.g., 2960 model), and 2 Routers (e.g., 4321 model).
3.  **Important:** Routers do not have serial interfaces by default. Click on a router, turn it off using the physical power switch, drag a `NIM-2T` module into an empty slot, and turn it back on. Do this for both routers.
4.  Connect the devices using the appropriate cables:
    -   **Copper Straight-Through:** PC to Switch, Switch to Router's GigabitEthernet port.
    -   **Serial DTE/DCE:** Router-A's Serial 0/0/0 to Router-B's Serial 0/0/0. **Note:** The first router you connect will be the DTE side. The second will be the DCE side, which is responsible for providing the clock signal.

### Task 2: Configure End Devices (PCs)

1.  Click on **PC-A**. Go to the **Desktop** tab -> **IP Configuration**.
2.  Set the IP address, Subnet Mask, and Default Gateway according to the table above.
3.  Repeat the process for **PC-B**.

### Task 3: Basic Router Configuration

You will use the Command Line Interface (CLI) for router configuration.

1.  Click on **Router-A**, go to the **CLI** tab.
2.  Enter privileged EXEC mode:
    ```bash
    enable
    ```
3.  Enter global configuration mode:
    ```bash
    configure terminal
    ```
4.  Configure the GigabitEthernet0/0 interface (the LAN connection):
    ```bash
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown
    exit
    ```
5.  Configure the Serial0/0/0 interface (the WAN connection):
    ```bash
    interface Serial0/0/0
    ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
    clock rate 64000  // This command is ONLY needed on the DCE side.
    no shutdown
    exit
    ```
6.  Repeat the process for **Router-B**, using its corresponding IP addresses from the table. **Do not** set the `clock rate` on Router-B if you set it on Router-A.

### Task 4: Verification and Analysis

Use the following commands to verify your configuration and test connectivity.

1.  **On PC-A**, open the **Command Prompt** and type:
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.1.1
    ```
    This tests connectivity to its default gateway (Router-A). It should be **successful**.

2.  **On PC-A**, try to ping the other PC:
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.2.10
    ```
    This ping should **fail**.

3.  **On Router-A**, use the following `show` commands in privileged EXEC mode:
    ```bash
    show ip interface brief
    ```
    This command verifies that your interfaces are up and have the correct IP addresses. The "Status" and "Protocol" columns should both say "up".

    ```bash
    show ip route
    ```
    Examine the output. You will see two networks listed as "C" (Connected).
    These are the networks that Router-A is physically attached to. Notice that the `192.168.2.0` network is **not** in this table.

## Exploration Questions

1.  Why did the ping from `PC-A` to its gateway `192.168.1.1` succeed?
2.  Why did the ping from `PC-A` to `PC-B` at `192.168.2.10` fail?
3.  Based on the output of `show ip route` on Router-A, explain in your own words why it cannot forward the packet to `PC-B`.
4.  What piece of information is missing from the routers that would allow them to communicate between the `192.168.1.0` and `192.168.2.0` networks? (This is what we will begin to solve next week!)
