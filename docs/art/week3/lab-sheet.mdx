# Week 3 Lab: Configuring and Troubleshooting RIPv1

## Objective

In this lab, you will replace manual static routes with a dynamic routing protocol. You will configure RIPv1 on a three-router topology, verify that all routers automatically learn the network map, and use powerful troubleshooting commands like `show ip protocols` and `debug ip rip` to observe the protocol's inner workings in real time.

## Required Software

-   Cisco Packet Tracer

## Network Topology

For this lab, we will use a new, slightly more complex topology to better observe dynamic routing. It consists of three routers in a line. We will use **loopback interfaces** to simulate attached LANs, as this is a quick and effective method in a lab environment.

### IP Addressing Scheme

| Device | Interface | IP Address | Subnet Mask |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Router-A** | S0/0/0 | `10.1.12.1` | `255.255.255.252` |
| | Loopback0 | `192.168.1.1` | `255.255.255.0` |
| **Router-B** | S0/0/0 | `10.1.12.2` | `255.255.255.252` |
| | S0/0/1 | `10.1.23.1` | `255.255.255.252` |
| | Loopback0 | `192.168.2.1` | `255.255.255.0` |
| **Router-C** | S0/0/1 | `10.1.23.2` | `255.255.255.252` |
| | Loopback0 | `192.168.3.1` | `255.255.255.0` |

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Build and Configure the Base Topology

1.  Place three routers (e.g., 4321 model) and connect them with Serial DTE/DCE cables as shown. Remember to add the `NIM-2T` serial modules to the routers first.
2.  Configure the IP addresses on the physical **serial interfaces** for all three routers according to the table. Remember to set a `clock rate` on the DCE side of each serial link and use `no shutdown`.
3.  Configure the **loopback interfaces**. A loopback is a virtual interface that is always up. It's great for simulating LANs.
    -   On **Router-A**:
        ```bash
        configure terminal
        interface Loopback0
        ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
        exit
        ```
    -   Repeat for Router-B and Router-C using their respective Loopback0 addresses.
4.  Verify your base config. Try to ping from Router-A (`10.1.12.1`) to Router-B (`10.1.12.2`). This should succeed. Now try to ping from Router-A (`10.1.12.1`) to Router-C (`10.1.23.2`). This should **fail** because there is no routing yet.

### Task 2: Configure RIPv1

1.  On **Router-A**, enter router configuration mode for RIP and add the classful networks it is connected to.
    ```bash
    router rip
    network 192.168.1.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    ```
2.  On **Router-B**, do the same for its connected networks.
    ```bash
    router rip
    network 192.168.2.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    ```
3.  On **Router-C**, do the same for its connected networks.
    ```bash
    router rip
    network 192.168.3.0
    network 10.0.0.0
    ```

### Task 3: Verification and Analysis

1.  Wait about 30-60 seconds for the routers to exchange updates and for the protocol to **converge**.
2.  On **Router-A**, view the routing table.
    ```bash
    show ip route
    ```
    You should see routes marked with an **'R'** for networks `192.168.2.0/24` and `192.168.3.0/24`.
3.  Examine the entry for `192.168.3.0/24`. It should show `[120/2]`. This means the route was learned via RIP (AD=120) and is 2 hops away.
4.  Confirm full connectivity. From Router-A's CLI, ping Router-C's loopback interface.
    ```bash
    ping 192.168.3.1
    ```
    The ping should now be **SUCCESSFUL**.

### Task 4: Troubleshooting and Observation

1.  On any router, use the `show ip protocols` command. This is one of the most useful verification commands.
    ```bash
    show ip protocols
    ```
    Observe the output. It confirms that RIP is running, shows the update timer interval (30s), and lists the networks that are being routed.
2.  Now for the powerful part. On **Router-B**, enable real-time debugging for RIP.
    ```bash
    debug ip rip
    ```
    Wait up to 30 seconds. You will see RIP updates being sent and received. You can see Router-B sending its table to A and C, and receiving their tables in return.
3.  **VERY IMPORTANT:** Turn off debugging as soon as you are done observing. In a production network, debugging can crash a router.
    ```bash
    undebug all
    ```

### Task 5 (Bonus): Simulating a Failure

1.  On **Router-C**, shut down the loopback interface to simulate a LAN failure.
    ```bash
    configure terminal
    interface Loopback0
    shutdown
    ```
2.  On **Router-B**, turn on `debug ip rip` again.
3.  Watch the debug output. When Router-C sends its next update to Router-B, you should see it advertise the `192.168.3.0` network with a metric of 16. This is **Route Poisoning** in action! Router-C is actively telling its neighbors that the network is dead.
4.  Remember to `undebug all` and bring the interface back up with `no shutdown` on Router-C when you're finished.

## Exploration Questions

1.  In the output of `show ip route` on Router-A, what is the hop count (metric) to reach Router-C's LAN (`192.168.3.1`)? Why is it that specific value?
2.  If the physical link between Router-B and Router-C was a very slow 64kbps connection, and the link between Router-A and Router-B was a super-fast 1Gbps connection, would RIP on Router-A choose a different path to get to Router-B's LAN? Why or why not?
3.  Why did we use the `network 10.0.0.0` command on all routers, even though they are connected to different `/30` subnets within the 10.0.0.0 range? What does this tell you about how RIPv1 processes network statements?
