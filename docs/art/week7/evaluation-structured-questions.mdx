**QUESTION 1 [25 MARKS]**

(a) In your own words, explain the fundamental difference in the operational logic between a link-state protocol like OSPF and a distance-vector protocol like RIP.

    **Answer:**

    The fundamental difference lies in the amount of information each router has.

    -   A **distance-vector** protocol like RIP operates on "routing by rumor." Each router only knows the information passed to it by its immediate neighbors. It does not have a view of the entire network; it simply trusts the distance and direction provided by its neighbors to reach a destination.
    -   A **link-state** protocol like OSPF provides every router with a complete topological map of the network area. Each router generates information about its own links (LSAs), floods this information to all other routers, and assembles an identical Link-State Database (LSDB). It then independently calculates the best path using this full map.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of the distance-vector "routing by rumor" approach.
    * [3 Marks] - For a clear explanation of the link-state "full map" or LSDB approach.

(b) Three routers are connected to the same multi-access Ethernet segment in OSPF Area 0. Their OSPF interface priorities and Router IDs are configured as follows:
-   **Router-A:** Priority = 50, Router-ID = 1.1.1.1
-   **Router-B:** Priority = 100, Router-ID = 2.2.2.2
-   **Router-C:** Priority = 1, Router-ID = 3.3.3.3

Determine which router will be elected the **Designated Router (DR)**, which will be the **Backup Designated Router (BDR)**, and which will be the **DROTHER**. You must justify your answer by explaining the two-step election process.

    **Answer:**

    * **DR:** Router-B
    * **BDR:** Router-A
    * **DROTHER:** Router-C

    **Justification:**
    The OSPF DR/BDR election process follows two rules in order:
    1.  **Highest OSPF Priority Wins:** The router with the highest priority on the segment is elected DR, and the second-highest is elected BDR. In this case, Router-B has the highest priority (100), so it becomes the DR. Router-A has the second-highest priority (50), so it becomes the BDR. Router-C has the lowest priority (1), so it becomes a DROTHER.
    2.  **Highest Router-ID as Tie-Breaker:** The Router ID is only used if there is a tie in priority. Since there was no tie for the DR or BDR positions, the router IDs of Router-A and Router-B were not needed for the election decision between them.

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [1 Mark] - For correctly identifying Router-B as DR.
    * [1 Mark] - For correctly identifying Router-A as BDR.
    * [1 Mark] - For correctly identifying Router-C as DROTHER.
    * [2 Marks] - For explaining that the highest priority wins first.
    * [2 Marks] - For explaining that the router ID is the tie-breaker but was not needed in this case for the DR/BDR selection.

(c) You are tasked with configuring OSPF on a new router. Write the full and exact set of commands to achieve the following:
-   Start the OSPF routing process with a process ID of 25.
-   Manually assign it a router-ID of `10.255.255.1`.
-   Enable OSPF on an interface with the IP `192.168.88.1/24` and add it to the backbone area.

    **Answer:**

    The configuration requires entering OSPF mode, setting the router-id, and using a network command with the correct wildcard mask and area ID.

    ```bash
    configure terminal
    router ospf 25
    router-id 10.255.255.1
    network 192.168.88.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
    ```

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [1 Mark] - For `router ospf 25`.
    * [2 Marks] - For the correct `router-id` command.
    * [3 Marks] - For the correct `network` command with the right wildcard mask and area ID.

(d) For two OSPF routers to successfully form a neighbor relationship, several parameters advertised in their Hello packets must be identical. List **four** such parameters.

    **Answer:**

    *(Student must list any four of the following)*

    1.  Area ID
    2.  Hello Timer interval
    3.  Dead Timer interval
    4.  Subnet Mask on the shared link
    5.  Authentication Type (if configured)
    6.  Authentication Password/Key (if configured)
    7.  Stub Area Flag

    **Marking Scheme:**

    * [1.5 Marks] - For each correctly identified parameter, up to a total of 6 marks.
