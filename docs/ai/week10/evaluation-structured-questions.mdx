### **Sample Examination Questions & Answers - Week 10 Concepts**

### **QUESTION 1 \[25 MARKS]**

---

#### (a) Diffusion Models are trained using a two-step process.

Describe the **Forward Process** and the **Reverse Process**. What is the main goal of the model during the training phase?
**\[6 Marks]**

### Answer

The **Forward Process** involves systematically destroying a real image from the training set by adding a small amount of Gaussian noise over many successive steps, until only pure random noise remains.

The **Reverse Process** is what the model learns to do. Its goal during training is to learn how to reverse this noising process. Specifically, the model is trained to look at a noisy image and **predict the noise** that was added to it in the previous step. By learning to predict and remove this noise, it effectively learns how to denoise an image step-by-step.

#### Marking Scheme

* **\[2 Marks]** - For a clear description of the Forward Process (adding noise to a real image).
* **\[2 Marks]** - For a clear description of the Reverse Process (predicting and removing noise).
* **\[2 Marks]** - For stating the training goal is to learn how to predict the noise.

#### (b) Explain how a trained Diffusion Model generates a completely new image, starting from a canvas of pure random noise.

### Answer

A trained Diffusion Model generates a new image by performing the **Reverse Process** iteratively.

1. It begins with a canvas of pure, random static (noise).
2. This noise is fed into the trained denoising network, which predicts the noise present in the image. It then subtracts a small amount of this predicted noise, revealing a very faint, abstract structure.
3. The slightly less noisy image is then fed back into the network. This process is repeated for hundreds or thousands of steps.

At each step, more noise is removed, and a more coherent and detailed image gradually emerges from the static, like a photograph developing in a darkroom. ðŸ“¸

#### Marking Scheme

* **\[2 Marks]** - For stating that generation starts with pure random noise.
* **\[3 Marks]** - For explaining the iterative denoising process where the model repeatedly predicts and removes noise to form the final image.

#### (c) Modern image generation models are guided by text prompts.

**i.** Describe the role of a **text encoder** in this process.
**\[4 Marks]**

### Answer

A **text encoder** (like CLIP) is a separate, pre-trained model whose job is to understand the meaning of the text prompt. It takes the raw text (e.g., *"a cat sitting on a beach"*) and converts it into a rich numerical representation called a **vector embedding**. This embedding captures the semantic meaning of the words and their relationships, providing a mathematical guide that the image generation model can understand.

#### Marking Scheme

* **\[2 Marks]** - For explaining that it converts text into a numerical vector embedding.
* **\[2 Marks]** - For mentioning that this embedding captures the semantic meaning of the prompt.

**ii.** Explain how the output of the text encoder is used to **condition** or **guide** the image generation process.
**\[4 Marks]**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

### Answer

The text embedding is fed into the denoising network at **each step of the reverse diffusion process**. It acts as a form of **guidance** or **conditioning**. This means the model isn't just removing noise randomly; it is removing noise in a specific way that steers the emerging image to align with the concepts contained in the text embedding. For example, it will denoise in a way that creates shapes and textures consistent with a "cat" and a "beach" if those were in the prompt.

---

#### Marking Scheme

* **\[2 Marks]** - For stating that the embedding is used at each step of the denoising process.
* **\[2 Marks]** - For explaining that it guides or steers the process to match the promptâ€™s meaning.

#### (d) A user wants to create a specific image: *"A Mauritian flying fox bat, in the style of a steampunk drawing"*

Explain how **prompt engineering**, including the use of **style modifiers** and **negative prompts**, can help achieve this specific result. ðŸŽ¨
**\[6 Marks]**

<details>
<summary>Click to see the answer and marking scheme</summary>

### Answer

**Prompt Engineering** is the skill of crafting the perfect text prompt to guide the AI toward a desired output.

1. **Style Modifiers:**
   To achieve the *"steampunk drawing"* look, the user would add specific style keywords to the prompt. Instead of just *"a bat"*, the prompt would become:
   *"A Mauritian flying fox bat, **steampunk drawing, intricate mechanical wings, gears and cogs, brass and copper, detailed line art**."*
   These modifiers guide the modelâ€™s aesthetic.

2. **Negative Prompts:**
   To ensure a high-quality drawing, the user can specify what to *avoid*.
   They would use a **negative prompt** like:
   *"**photograph, blurry, ugly, deformed, low quality, color**."*
   This tells the model to avoid realism and maintain the drawn, stylistic nature.

By combining a detailed main prompt with a targeted negative prompt, the user has **maximum control** over the final generated artwork.

#### Marking Scheme

* **\[3 Marks]** - For a clear explanation and example of using style modifiers to control the aesthetic.
* **\[3 Marks]** - For a clear explanation and example of using negative prompts to remove unwanted elements.
