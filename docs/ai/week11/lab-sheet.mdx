### **Lab Guide**

**Lab 11: Final Project Workshop & Ideation Session**

**Objective:** To help you select a project track, brainstorm ideas, find a suitable dataset, and create an initial project plan. This session is a workshop, not a traditional lab.

---

### Part A: Brainstorming Your Project

Use the following questions to help you think of an idea for your chosen track.

#### The Predictor
* What could you predict that would be useful for a business or organization in Mauritius? (e.g., daily electricity demand, number of arrivals at the airport, customer churn for a telecom company).
* What classification could you perform? (e.g., classifying a news article's topic, determining if a loan application should be approved).

#### The Visionary
* What visual problem in Mauritius could you help solve? (e.g., identifying invasive plant species, classifying the condition of coral reefs from photos, checking if a worker is wearing a safety helmet).
* What kind of creative image classification could you do? (e.g., classifying different styles of local architecture, identifying different Mauritian dishes).

#### The Creator
* What kind of text could you generate that would be useful or entertaining? (e.g., generate tourist-friendly descriptions of local landmarks, create marketing copy for a new product, write short stories).
* What kind of images could you create? (e.g., A series of artistic interpretations of Mauritian history, designs for new local products, conceptual art for a video game set in Mauritius).

### Part B: Finding Data

For most projects, you'll need data. Here are some excellent places to start your search:
* **Kaggle:** An enormous repository of datasets for a wide range of problems.
* **Google Dataset Search:** A search engine specifically for datasets.
* **UCI Machine Learning Repository:** A classic, high-quality collection of datasets.
* **Mauritius Open Data Portal:** For official data related to Mauritius.

For generative tasks, you will be using a pre-trained model, so you may not need a dataset, but you will need a clear idea and prompt engineering strategy.

### Part C: Project Proposal Outline

By the end of this workshop, your goal is to have a rough, one-page proposal. It should include:

1.  **Project Title:** A clear, descriptive title.
2.  **Selected Track:** Predictor, Visionary, or Creator.
3.  **Problem Statement:** A 1-2 sentence summary of what you are trying to solve or create.
4.  **Dataset/Model:** A link to the dataset you plan to use, or the name of the pre-trained model you plan to use (e.g., `Stable Diffusion v1.5`).
5.  **Ethical Considerations:** A brief statement (1-2 sentences) on a potential bias or ethical issue related to your project (e.g., "My loan prediction model could be biased against certain demographics if the training data is not representative.").
