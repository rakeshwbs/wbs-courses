### **6. Module Content**
This module takes students on a narrative journey through three key stages of modern AI. 
The journey begins with 
- **Part 1: The Foundations**, where students master supervised and unsupervised machine learning to predict outcomes 
and discover hidden patterns in data. 
- **Part 2: Perception** focuses on teaching machines to see and understand, covering applied Computer Vision with OpenCV and 
building deep learning models for vision (CNNs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The final stage, 
- **Part 3: The Frontier**, pushes into the most advanced topics, exploring how AI learns through trial and error with Reinforcement Learning and how it can create novel 
content with Generative AI (LLMs and Diffusion Models). The module is designed to be highly practical, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of how to architect modern AI systems.
---
### **7. Teaching and Learning Methods**

    The module will be delivered through a blend of bi-weekly lectures, hands-on practical lab sessions, and self-directed study. Lectures will introduce core theories and concepts, while the mandatory lab sessions will focus on applying this knowledge to solve real-world problems using industry-standard programming tools.
