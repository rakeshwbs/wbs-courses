## Presentation Structure (5-Minute Demo)

To ensure everyone has a chance to present, please structure your demo strictly around the following 5-minute format. Practice your timing!

### The Hook (30 seconds)
* State your name, project title, and chosen track (Predictor, Visionary, or Creator).
* In one or two sentences, clearly state the problem you solved or the thing you created. Grab our attention!

### The "How" (2 minutes)
* Briefly introduce your dataset or the pre-trained model you used.
* What was the core AI technique you implemented? (e.g., "I used a CNN built with Keras," or "I used TF-IDF with a Logistic Regression classifier," or "I used Stable Diffusion with prompt engineering.")
* Show us a key snippet of your code or a diagram of your model's architecture.

### The "Wow" - Live Demo! (2 minutes)
* **This is the most important part.** Show, don't just tell.
* Run your Jupyter Notebook. Give your model a new input and show the prediction. Display the image you generated. Show us your model in action!

### The Reflection (30 seconds)
* Briefly, what was your biggest challenge or most important learning?
* What is one ethical consideration related to your project?
