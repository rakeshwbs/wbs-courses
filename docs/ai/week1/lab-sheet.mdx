# **Lab Guide**

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
- Go to the website: https://colab.research.google.com

- A popup window will appear. Click on New notebook.

<div className="q-card">
    <p>You should now see a new tab with a file named ***Untitled0.ipynb***. This is your first notebook!</p>
</div>


### Step 2: The Notebook Interface
You'll see a blinking cursor in a box. This is called a cell. There are two types:

1. Code Cells:
        - Where you write and run Python code.

2. Text Cells:
        - Where you can write notes, like this one.

To run the code inside a cell, you can
                                        - either click the little "play" button ▶️ to the left of the cell
                                        - or press Shift + Enter on your keyboard.

### Step 3: Writing Your First Python Code

Let's start with the basics. In AI, we are constantly working with data and variables.

Click into the first code cell and type the following. Then, run the cell.

```python
# This is a comment. Python ignores lines starting with #.
# Let's create our first variable.
message = "Hello, AI!"

# Now, let's print the content of the variable.
print(message)

# We can also do math.
a = 10
b = 25
print(a + b)

```
#### Expected Output:
<div class="expected-output">
Hello, AI!
35
</div>

### Step 4: Essential Data Types
In AI, you'll mainly deal with numbers (for measurements, pixels, etc.) and text.

Let's see the basic Python types. Copy this code into a new cell and run it.

```python
# An integer (a whole number)
num_of_samples = 100
print("Type of num_of_samples is:", type(num_of_samples))

# A float (a number with a decimal point)
learning_rate = 0.001
print("Type of learning_rate is:", type(learning_rate))

# A string (text)
model_name = "Classifier_v1"
print("Type of model_name is:", type(model_name))

# A list (a collection of items)
# In AI, this could be a list of features or data points.
feature_names = ["age", "height", "weight"]
print("This is a list:", feature_names)
```
#### Expected Output
<div class="expected-output">
    Type of num_of_samples is: &lt;class 'int'&gt;
    Type of learning_rate is: &lt;class 'float'&gt;
    Type of model_name is: &lt;class 'str'&gt;
    This is a list: ['age', 'height', 'weight']
</div>
