### **Lab Guide**

**Lab 01: Setting Up Your AI Development Environment & Tooling**
:::tip OBJECTIVE
- By the end of this lab, you will have a fully functional Python environment for AI development and will have performed basic operations using the core libraries: NumPy and Pandas.
:::
#### **Part A: Installation of Anaconda**

Anaconda is a distribution of Python that includes many of the most popular packages for data science and AI. It also manages virtual environments, which is crucial for avoiding package conflicts.

1.  **Download:** Navigate to the Anaconda Distribution website: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2.  **Select:** Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Ensure you select the version for **Python 3.9+**.
3.  **Install:** Run the installer. **It is highly recommended that you accept the default settings**, especially the option that adds Anaconda to your system's PATH (this may be the default on macOS/Linux but an option on Windows).
4.  **Verify:**
* **Windows:** Open the "Anaconda Prompt" from your Start Menu.
* **macOS/Linux:** Open your regular Terminal.
* In the prompt/terminal, type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see "Python 3.x.x :: Anaconda, Inc.".

#### **Part B: Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter is an interactive, web-based tool that allows you to write and execute code, add text and images, and see your results all in one document. It's the standard for data science exploration.

1.  **Launch:** In your Anaconda Prompt or Terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to store your course work (e.g., `cd Desktop/AFI-373`).
2.  Type `jupyter notebook` and press Enter.
3.  This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter file browser.
4.  **Create a Notebook:** Click the "New" button in the top right and select "Python 3 (ipykernel)".
5.  **Tour:** You are now in a notebook. Notice the "cell." You can write Python code in it. Press **Shift + Enter** to run the code in a cell. Try it now with `print("Hello, AI Architect!")`.
6.  You can change a cell's type from "Code" to "Markdown" in the toolbar to write text, like these instructions.

#### **Part C: NumPy Crash Course**

NumPy is the fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object.

*In a new cell in your Jupyter Notebook, type the following code and run it.*

```python
import numpy as np # np is the standard alias

# Create a 1D array (a vector)
a = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
print(f"Vector a: {a}")

# Create a 2D array (a matrix)
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(f"Matrix b:\n{b}")

# Perform mathematical operations
c = a * 2
print(f"Vector a * 2: {c}")

# Check the shape of an array
print(f"Shape of matrix b: {b.shape}")
```

#### **Part D: Pandas Crash Course**

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is the primary tool for data manipulation and analysis. It introduces the "DataFrame," which is like a powerful spreadsheet you can control with code.

*In a new cell, type the following code.*

```python
import pandas as pd # pd is the standard alias

# Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {
    'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Mango'],
    'Price_MUR': [15, 12, 8, 25],
    'In_Stock': [True, True, False, True]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print("My Fruit Store DataFrame:")
print(df)

# Get the first few rows
print("\nFirst 2 rows:")
print(df.head(2))

# Get basic descriptive statistics
print("\nBasic stats for Price:")
print(df['Price_MUR'].describe())

# Select a single column
print("\nJust the fruits:")
print(df['Fruit'])
```

**Congratulations\!** Your development environment is now ready. You have installed the necessary tools and have hands-on experience with the two most important libraries in our AI journey. 
In Week 2, we will use these tools to build our first predictive model.
