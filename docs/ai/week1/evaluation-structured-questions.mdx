                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science concerned with creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.</p>

                <p><strong>Category:</strong> <em>Limited Memory</em>.</p>
                <p><strong>Justification:</strong> The system goes beyond purely reactive behaviour by using recent observations (speed and direction) to inform immediate decisions. The memory is short-lived and not stored permanently, which defines Limited Memory AI.</p>
