### Solving Simultaneous Equations
---
Simultaneous equations are a pair of equations with two unknown variables. The goal is to find the single value for **x** and **y** that makes both equations true at the same time. The most common algebraic method used in the exam papers is the **elimination method**.

### The Elimination Method

1.  **Multiply:** If necessary, multiply one or both equations so that the coefficient (the number in front) of either `x` or `y` is the same in both equations.
2.  **Eliminate:** Add or subtract the two equations to eliminate the variable with the matching coefficient.
3.  **Solve:** Solve the resulting simple equation to find the value of the first variable.
4.  **Substitute:** Substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find the value of the second variable.

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 13
Solve the following simultaneous equations algebraically:
$7x - y = 30$
$4x + 5y = 6$
:::
:::success Answer
$x = 4$, $y = -2$ ✔️
:::note Explanation

1.  **Label Equations:**
  * (1) $7x - y = 30$
  * (2) $4x + 5y = 6$
2.  **Multiply:** To eliminate `y`, multiply equation (1) by 5 so the `y` coefficients match.
  * (3) $35x - 5y = 150$
3.  **Eliminate:** Add the new equation (3) to equation (2) to eliminate the `y` term.
```
  35x - 5y = 150
+  4x + 5y = 6
-----------------
  39x      = 156
```
4.  **Solve for x:**
$$x = \frac{156}{39} \implies x = 4$$
5.  **Substitute:** Substitute $x=4$ back into the original equation (1):
$$7(4) - y = 30$$   $$28 - y = 30 \implies y = -2$$

$5x - 3y = 13$
$x + 2y = -26$
:::
:::success Answer
$x = -4$, $y = -11$ ✔️
:::note Explanation

1.  **Label Equations:**
  * (1) $5x - 3y = 13$
  * (2) $x + 2y = -26$
2.  **Multiply:** To eliminate `x`, multiply equation (2) by 5.

3.  **Eliminate:** Subtract the original equation (1) from the new equation (3).
```
   5x + 10y = -130
- (5x -  3y =   13)
--------------------
        13y = -143
```
4.  **Solve for y:**
$$y = \frac{-143}{13} \implies y = -11$$
5.  **Substitute:** Substitute $y=-11$ back into the original equation (2):
$$x + 2(-11) = -26$$   $$x - 22 = -26 \implies x = -4$$
