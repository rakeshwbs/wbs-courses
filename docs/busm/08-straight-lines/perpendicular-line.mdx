### Perpendicular line
---
**Perpendicular lines** are two lines that intersect each other at a perfect **right angle (90°)**.

### The Gradient Rule
The most important property of perpendicular lines is the relationship between their gradients. If one line has a gradient of **`m₁`**, the gradient of a line perpendicular to it, **`m₂`**, will be its **negative reciprocal**.

To find the negative reciprocal, you do two things:
1.  **Find the reciprocal** (flip the fraction).
2.  **Change the sign** (positive becomes negative, and negative becomes positive).

The formula is:
$$m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}$$

This also means that the product of the two gradients will always be **-1**.

$$m_1 \times m_2 = -1$$

### Example
* If a line has a gradient of **4**, the gradient of a line perpendicular to it is **$-\frac{1}{4}$**.
* If a line has a gradient of **$-\frac{2}{3}$**, the gradient of a line perpendicular to it is **$\frac{3}{2}$**.

| Equation of the Line | Gradient (m) | Perpendicular Gradient ($-\frac{1}{m}$) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| $y = 5x - 7$  | 5 | $-\frac{1}{5}$ |
| $y = -2x + 5$  | -2 | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
| $y = \frac{x}{5} + 3$ | $\frac{1}{5}$ | -5 |
| $y = -x + 3$  | -1 | 1 |
| $2x + y = 4$ | -2 | $\frac{1}{2}$ |

### Finding the Equation of a Perpendicular Line
---

To find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to a given line and passes through a specific point, you can follow these steps.

#### **Step 1: Find the Gradient (m) of the Original Line**
- First, you have to ensure that the equation of the line given is in the form of **`y = mx + c`**.

- Once it is in this form, you can read the value of **`m`**, which is the gradient.

#### **Step 2: Find the Gradient of the Perpendicular Line**
To find the gradient of the perpendicular line, you do two things to the original gradient (`m`):
* **Find the reciprocal** (flip the fraction; for example, 3 becomes $$\frac{1}{3}$$).
* **Change the sign** (if the sign is positive, change it to negative; if it is negative, change it to positive).

This new gradient is the "negative reciprocal" of the original.

#### **Step 3: Find the Y-Intercept (c) of the New Line**

Now, write the equation of the perpendicular line in the form of `y = (new gradient)x + c`.

You can find the value of `c` by replacing the values of `x` and `y` with the coordinates of the point that the perpendicular line passes through.

#### **Step 4: Write the Final Equation**

Finally, write out the equation using the new gradient and the value of `c` you just found.

### **Worked Example**

**Problem:** Find the equation of the line perpendicular to `y = -2x + 5` that passes through the point **(4, 8)**.

1.  **Find the Original Gradient:**

The equation `y = -2x + 5` is already in the correct form. The original gradient **`m` is -2**.

2.  **Find the Perpendicular Gradient:**
* The reciprocal of -2 (or $$\frac{-2}{1}$$) is $$\frac{-1}{2}$$.
* Change the sign from negative to positive.
* The new, perpendicular gradient is **$$\frac{1}{2}$$**.

3.  **Find the Y-Intercept (c):**
* Start with the new equation: $$y = \frac{1}{2}x + c$$.
* Substitute the point (x=4, y=8):

    $$8 = (\frac{1}{2})(4) + c$$.
* This simplifies to `8 = 2 + c`.
* Solving for `c` gives **`c = 6`**.

4.  **Write the Final Equation:**

The final equation for the perpendicular line is:
$$y = \frac{1}{2}x + 6$$
