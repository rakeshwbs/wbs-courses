### What the Gradient Tells You
The value of the gradient provides two key pieces of information about the line:

#### Direction
* A **positive gradient** means the line slopes **upwards** from left to right.
* A **negative gradient** means the line slopes **downwards** from left to right.
* A **zero gradient** means the line is perfectly **horizontal**.

#### Steepness
* The **larger** the absolute value of the gradient, the **steeper** the line is. For example, a line with a gradient of 4 is steeper than a line with a gradient of 1.



---
### How It's Calculated

- The gradient is calculated as the ratio of the vertical change (the "rise") to the horizontal change (the "run") between any two points on the line.
- $$\text{Gradient (m)} = \frac{\text{Change in Y (Rise)}}{\text{Change in X (Run)}}$$

### Find Gradient from Equation
---
To find the gradient from a linear equation, first ensure the equation is in the standard form **`y = mx + c`**. The gradient is the value of **`m`**.

### How to Find the Gradient

1.  **Arrange the Equation:** Make sure the equation is written so that **`y`** is isolated on one side.
2.  **Identify the 'm' value:** The gradient (`m`) is the number (or coefficient) that is directly multiplying the **`x`** term.

---
### Examples

* For the equation `y = 5x - 7`, the number multiplying `x` is **5**.

Therefore, the gradient is **5**.

* In `y = -x + 3`, the number multiplying `x` is **-1**. The gradient is **-1**.

* In y = **$$\frac{x}{5}$$** + 3, which can be rewritten as y = (**$$\frac{1}{5}$$**)x + 3, the number multiplying `x` is **$$\frac{1}{5}$$**.

The gradient is **$$\frac{1}{5}$$**.

---
:::warning When the Equation Needs Rearranging
Sometimes the equation isn't in the perfect `y = mx + c` format. For example, if you had an equation like `2y = 4x + 1`, you must first solve for `y` by dividing the entire equation by 2:

$$y = \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \implies y = 2x + \frac{1}{2}$$

Now that it's in the correct format, you can see the gradient **`m` is 2**.

## Finding Gradient from two given points
---
To find the gradient of a line when given two points, you calculate the ratio of the vertical change (the "rise") to the horizontal change (the "run") between those points.

### The Method
The method uses a standard formula. Given two points, $(x₁, y₁)$ and $(x₂, y₂)$, the gradient (`m`) is calculated as follows:

1.  **Label your points:** Assign one point as $(x₁, y₁)$ and the other as $(x₂, y₂)$. It doesn't matter which is which, as long as you are consistent.
2.  **Apply the formula:** Substitute your values into the gradient formula:
$$m = \frac{\text{Change in Y}}{\text{Change in X}} = \frac{y₂ - y₁}{x₂ - x₁}$$
3.  **Calculate** the final value.

### Worked Example

**Problem:** Find the gradient of the line joining the points **(-1, 3)** and **(3, 5)**.

1.  **Label the points:**
* Let $(x₁, y₁) = (-1, 3)$
* Let $(x₂, y₂) = (3, 5)$

2.  **Apply the formula:**
$$m = \frac{5 - 3}{3 - (-1)}$$

3.  **Calculate the result:**
$$m = \frac{2}{3 + 1} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$

The gradient of the line is **$$\frac{1}{2}$$** (or **0.5**).
