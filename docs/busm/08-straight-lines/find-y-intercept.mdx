### What is the y-intercept?
---
The **y-intercept** is the point where a line or curve crosses the vertical **y-axis** of a graph.

</div>


### Key Characteristics

* At this specific point, the **x-coordinate is always zero**.
* In the standard equation of a straight line, **`y = mx + c`**, the y-intercept is the value of **`c`**.
* The coordinate of the y-intercept is always written as **(0, c)**.



### Real-World Example
- In a business context, the y-intercept often represents a **starting value** or a **fixed cost**.
- For instance, in a cost equation like `Cost = 2x + 50` (where `x` is the number of items produced), the y-intercept is **50**.
- This represents the fixed cost (Â£50) that exists even before any items are produced (when `x=0`).

### Find Y-Intercept
---
To find the y-intercept from a linear equation, first make sure the equation is in the standard form **`y = mx + c`**. The y-intercept is the value of **`c`**.

### How to Find the Y-Intercept

1.  **Arrange the Equation:** Make sure the equation is written so that **`y`** is by itself on one side.
2.  **Identify the 'c' value:** The **y-intercept (`c`)** is the constant number that is not attached to the `x` term.
3.  **State the Coordinate:** The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the vertical y-axis. Its coordinate is always **(0, c)**.

***
### Examples from Past Papers

* For the equation `y = 4x - 2`, the constant term is **-2**.

The y-intercept is **-2**, and the coordinate is **(0, -2)**.
* In y = 2x + $$\frac{1}{2}$$, the constant term is **$$\frac{1}{2}$$**.
The y-intercept is **$$\frac{1}{2}$$**.
* In `y = x + 2`, the constant term is **2**.

The y-intercept is **2**.

:::warning When the Equation Needs Rearranging

Sometimes the equation isn't in the perfect `y = mx + c` format.

For example, to find the y-intercept of `2y = 4x + 1`, you must first solve for a single `y` by dividing the entire equation by 2:

$$y = \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \implies y = 2x + \frac{1}{2}$$

Now that it's in the correct format, you can see the y-intercept **`c` is $$\frac{1}{2}$$**.
