### Find Equation of a Line

### CASE I - **Finding the Equation from Two Points**

When you are given two points but not the gradient, you must first calculate the gradient using the two points. The process involves three main steps.

#### **Step 1: Calculate the Gradient (m)**

Use the two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, in the gradient formula:
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

#### **Step 2: Find the Y-Intercept (c)**

Now that you have the gradient, you can use it along with **either one** of the two points to find the y-intercept.

1.  Start with the general equation: `y = mx + c`.
2.  Substitute the gradient (`m`) you just calculated.
3.  Substitute the `x` and `y` values from one of the points.
4.  Solve the equation to find `c`.

#### **Step 3: Write the Final Equation**

Combine the gradient (`m`) from Step 1 and the y-intercept (`c`) from Step 2 to write the final equation in the form `y = mx + c`.

### **Worked Example**

Find the equation of the line that passes through the points **(-1, 3)** and **(3, 5)**.

* **Step 1: Calculate the Gradient (m)**
Let $(x_1, y_1) = (-1, 3)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (3, 5)$.

$$m = \frac{5 - 3}{3 - (-1)} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$$

The gradient of the line is **$$\frac{1}{2}$$**.

* **Step 2: Find the Y-Intercept (c)**
Start with $$y = \frac{1}{2}x + c$$

Now, use one of the points (we'll use (3, 5)) to find `c`.


$$5 = \frac{1}{2}(3) + c$$

$$5 = \frac{3}{2}+ c$$

$$c = 5 - 1.5 = 3.5$$

The y-intercept is **3.5**.

**Step 3: Write the Final Equation**

    Now that we have $$m = \frac{1}{2}$$ and `c = 3.5`, the final equation is:
    $$y = \frac{1}{2}x + 3.5$$

### CASE II - **Given the Gradient and a Point**

To find the equation of a line, you need to determine its gradient (**m**) and its y-intercept (**c**)
and put them into the standard form **`y = mx + c`**.

The general method involves these steps:
1.  **Substitute the Gradient (m):** Place the given gradient value into the equation `y = mx + c`.
2.  **Substitute the Point (x, y):** Use the coordinates of the given point to replace `x` and `y` in the equation.
3.  **Solve for the Y-Intercept (c):** Rearrange the equation to find the value of `c`.
4.  **Write the Final Equation:** Combine the gradient and the newly found y-intercept.

### Example 1: Given the Gradient and the Y-Intercept (where x=0)

This is the most straightforward case. When the given point has an x-coordinate of 0, its y-coordinate is the y-intercept (`c`).

**Problem:** Find the equation of a line with a gradient of **-3** that passes through the point **(0, 5)**.

**Solution:**
* We are given the gradient **`m = -3`**.
* Because the line passes through (0, 5), it crosses the y-axis at 5. Therefore, the y-intercept **`c = 5`**.
* Substituting these values directly into `y = mx + c`, we get:

    * $$y = -3x + 5$$

### Example 2: Given the Gradient and Any Point (where xâ‰ 0)

This method requires a few algebraic steps to find the y-intercept.

**Problem:** Find the equation of a line with a gradient of **2** that passes through the point **(3, 10)**.

**Solution:**
1.  **Substitute the gradient (m):**

Start with `y = mx + c` and substitute `m=2`:

$$y = 2x + c$$

2.  **Substitute the point (x, y):**

Use the coordinates `x=3` and `y=10` in the equation:

$$10 = 2(3) + c$$

3.  **Solve for the y-intercept (c):**

$$10 = 6 + c$$

$$c = 10 - 6$$

$$c = 4$$

4.  **Write the final equation:**

Now that we know `m=2` and `c=4`, the final equation is:

$$y = 2x + 4$$
