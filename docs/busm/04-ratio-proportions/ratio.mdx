### **Concept: Ratios**

A **ratio** is used to compare the sizes of two or more quantities. It shows how much of one thing there is in relation to another, without expressing the actual measured values.

#### **1. Simplifying Ratios**
Just like fractions, ratios should be simplified to their lowest terms. This is done by finding the highest common factor for all parts of the ratio and dividing each part by it.
* **Example:** The ratio `10 : 15` can be simplified by dividing both sides by 5, resulting in `2 : 3`.

#### **2. Dividing a Quantity in a Given Ratio**
This is a common business task, used for anything from allocating funds to distributing goods.
1.  **Find the total number of parts:** Add the numbers in the ratio together. For a ratio of `a : b : c`, the total parts are `a + b + c`.
2.  **Find the value of one part:** Divide the total quantity you are sharing by the total number of parts.
3.  **Calculate the share for each item:** Multiply the value of one part by its corresponding number in the ratio.

#### **Simplifying a Ratio**

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 2
Simplify the ratio 8:24:44.
:::
:::success Answer
2 : 6 : 11 ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the Highest Common Factor (HCF):** Look for the largest number that divides into 8, 24, and 44. The HCF is 4.
2.  **Divide each part by the HCF:**
* $$\frac{8}{4} = 2$$
* $$\frac{24}{4} = 6$$
* $$\frac{44}{4} = 11$$
3.  **Simplified Ratio:** The simplified ratio is 2 : 6 : 11.

:::danger 7 March 2024, Section B, Question 21
A zoo sells THREE (3) types of tickets: adult, child, and student. These tickets are sold in the ratio 6:4:1. On Saturday, the zoo sells 4840 tickets. Calculate the number of each type of ticket sold.
:::
:::success Answer
Adults: 2640, Children: 1760, Students: 440 ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the total number of parts:** $6 + 4 + 1 = 11$ parts.
2.  **Find the value of one part:** Divide the total number of tickets by the total parts:
$$\frac{4840}{11} = 440 \text{ tickets per part}$$
3.  **Calculate the share for each ticket type:**
* **Adult:** $6 \text{ parts} \times 440 = 2640$ tickets.
* **Child:** $4 \text{ parts} \times 440 = 1760$ tickets.
* **Student:** $1 \text{ part} \times 440 = 440$ tickets.

#### **Finding the Total from One Part**

:::danger 14 March 2023, Section B, Question 21
A bakery sold loaves of bread (white, wholemeal, seeded) in the ratio 5:4:3. On a particular day 15 seeded loaves were sold. Calculate the total number of loaves sold.
:::
:::success Answer
60 loaves ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the value of one part:** We know that the 3 parts representing seeded loaves are equal to 15.
$$\text{Value of one part} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ loaves}$$
2.  **Find the total number of parts:** $5 + 4 + 3 = 12$ parts in total.
3.  **Calculate the total loaves sold:** Multiply the total parts by the value of one part:
$$12 \text{ parts} \times 5 = 60 \text{ loaves}$$

#### **Solving Problems with the Difference Between Parts**

:::danger 8 March 2022, Section B, Question 23
On Saturday, Mo, Lily and Jay share their tips in the ratio 4:7:5. Lily receives £20 more than Jay. Calculate the amount of money that Mo receives.
:::
:::success Answer
Mo receives £40 ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the difference in parts:**
* Lily's share is 7 parts.
* Jay's share is 5 parts.
* The difference is $7 - 5 = 2$ parts.
2.  **Find the value of one part:** We are told this difference of 2 parts is equal to £20.
$$\text{Value of one part} = \frac{£20}{2} = £10$$
3.  **Calculate Mo's share:** Mo's share is 4 parts.
$$4 \text{ parts} \times £10 = £40$$
