### **Concept: Proportion**

**Proportion** describes a relationship where two quantities change at a constant rate. While a ratio compares two quantities, a proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.

#### **1. Direct Proportion**
This is the most common type of proportion. It means that as one quantity **increases**, the other quantity **increases** at the same rate (and vice versa). For example, the more you buy of an item, the more it costs.

The best way to solve these problems is with the **Unitary Method**:
1.  **Find the value of one unit:** Divide the known quantity by its corresponding number of parts.
2.  **Calculate the required value:** Multiply the value of one unit by the new number of parts you need.

#### **2. Inverse Proportion**
This means that as one quantity **increases**, the other quantity **decreases** at a constant rate. For example, the more people you have working on a job, the less time it will take.

#### **Direct Proportion**

:::danger 12 September 2023, Section B, Question 23
The amount of mozzarella cheese a restaurant uses each day is directly proportional to the number of pizzas they sell. For TWELVE (12) pizzas the restaurant uses 2040g of mozzarella cheese. Calculate the amount of mozzarella cheese the restaurant would need if they sold TWENTY (20) pizzas.
:::
:::success Answer
3400g of mozzarella ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the value of one unit (pizza):** Divide the total amount of cheese by the number of pizzas to find out how much cheese is needed for one pizza.
$$\frac{2040g}{12 \text{ pizzas}} = 170g \text{ per pizza}$$
2.  **Calculate the required value:** Multiply the amount of cheese per pizza by the new number of pizzas.
$$170g \times 20 \text{ pizzas} = 3400g$$

A recipe for an apple pie to serve SIX (6) people requires 240 grams of flour. Rafi is making an equivalent apple pie for FOUR (4) people. How much flour does he need?
:::
:::success Answer
160 grams of flour ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the value of one unit (person):** Divide the total flour by the number of people.
$$\frac{240g}{6 \text{ people}} = 40g \text{ per person}$$
2.  **Calculate the required value:** Multiply the amount of flour per person by the new number of people.
$$40g \times 4 \text{ people} = 160g$$

#### **Inverse Proportion**

:::danger 14 March 2023, Section B, Question 21
The bakery employs TWO (2) bakers. It takes them SEVEN (7) hours to produce all the products required each day. Find an equation that links the number of bakers, x, to the amount of time y, it takes to produce all the bakery products.
:::
:::success Answer
$y = \frac{14}{x}$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the total work:** First, find the total "baker-hours" needed for the job. This is an inverse proportion, so we multiply the quantities.
$$2 \text{ bakers} \times 7 \text{ hours} = 14 \text{ baker-hours}$$
This means the total amount of work is a constant 14.
2.  **Form the equation:** The time taken (`y`) is the total work (14) divided by the number of bakers (`x`).
$$y = \frac{14}{x}$$
For example, if you had 1 baker, it would take 14 hours. If you had 7 bakers, it would take 2 hours.

Two variables, s and t, are in inverse proportion. Given that s = 1.3 when t = 5, calculate the value of s when t = 8.
:::
:::success Answer
s = 0.8125 ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Find the constant of proportionality (k):** In inverse proportion, the product of the two variables is constant ($s \times t = k$).
$$k = 1.3 \times 5 = 6.5$$
2.  **Form the equation:** The relationship is $s \times t = 6.5$, or $s = \frac{6.5}{t}$.
3.  **Calculate the new value:** Use the equation to find `s` when `t = 8`.
$$s = \frac{6.5}{8} = 0.8125$$
