### **Concept: Moving Averages** üìà

A **moving average** is a technique used in business to analyze a set of data points collected over time (a time series). Its main purpose is to **smooth out short-term fluctuations** (or "noise") in the data to make it easier to see the underlying, long-term trend.

The "n-point" part (e.g., 5-point, 4-point, 3-point) tells you how many consecutive data points to average together at each step. The calculation then "moves" along the dataset, dropping the oldest data point and adding the newest one for each subsequent average.

* A **3-point** moving average looks at 3 data points at a time.
* A **4-point** moving average is often used for quarterly data to smooth out seasonal variations over a year.
* A **5-point** moving average looks at 5 data points, which might be used to see the trend in data collected over a 5-day work week.
