:::danger Question Nov 2024 Question 24
a)
The average number of passengers travelling on the 7.25 am train from Greenville to Midtown is recorded each quarter for the past THREE (3) years and is shown in the table below:

| Year | 2021 |   |   |   | 2022 |   |   |   | 2023 |   |   |   |
|------|------|---|---|---|------|---|---|---|------|---|---|---|
| Quarter | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Average number of passengers | 76 | 72 | 75 | 89 | 88 | 78 | 83 | 92 | 94 | 81 | 88 | 98 |

i) Draw a time series graph for this data using the graph paper provided.

ii) Calculate the ninth 4-point moving average.

iii) The first EIGHT (8) 4-point moving averages for the data are 78, 81, 82.5, 84.5, 85.25, 86.75, 87.5, and 88.75. Plot these moving averages and the moving average calculated in (ii) on the time series graph plotted in Q24 (a)(i) and draw the trendline.

iv) Use the graph constructed in Q24 (a)(iii) to make TWO (2) comments upon seasonality and trend.

v) Use the trendline to predict the next moving average. Hence estimate the number of passengers in the first quarter of 2024.

vi) The trendline is used to estimate the number of passengers in Quarter 3 of 2024. State whether the Quarter 1 2024 estimate or the Quarter 3 2024 estimate will be more reliable. Explain your answer.

b) State whether the data collected in part (a) is continuous or discrete. Briefly explain your answer.
