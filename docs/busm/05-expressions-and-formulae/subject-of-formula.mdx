### **Concept: Changing the Subject of a Formula**

Changing the subject of a formula means rearranging it so that a different variable is isolated on one side of the equals sign.

The fundamental rule is to keep the equation **balanced**. Whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation, you must also perform on the other. To isolate the desired variable, you "undo" the operations around it by applying their inverses in the reverse order of BODMAS.

**Inverse Operations:**
* Addition and Subtraction are inverses.
* Multiplication and Division are inverses.
* Squaring and taking the Square Root are inverses.

### **Worked Examples from Past Papers**

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 17
Make b the subject of the following equation: $7a=\frac{10c}{b^{2}}-4$
:::
:::success Answer
$$b = \sqrt{\frac{10c}{7a+4}}$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `b`.
2.  **Add 4 to both sides** to isolate the term containing `b`:
$$7a + 4 = \frac{10c}{b^2}$$
3.  **Multiply both sides by $b^2$** to move it out of the denominator:
$$b^2(7a + 4) = 10c$$
4.  **Divide both sides by $(7a + 4)$** to isolate $b^2$:
$$b^2 = \frac{10c}{7a + 4}$$
5.  **Take the square root of both sides** to solve for `b`:
$$b = \sqrt{\frac{10c}{7a + 4}}$$

:::danger 10 September 2024, Section A, Question 13
Make s the subject of the following equation: $r=\frac{7+t}{4+s}$
:::
:::success Answer
$$s = \frac{7+t}{r} - 4$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `s`.
2.  **Multiply both sides by $(4+s)$** to remove the fraction:
$$r(4+s) = 7+t$$
3.  **Divide both sides by `r`**:
$$4+s = \frac{7+t}{r}$$
4.  **Subtract 4 from both sides** to isolate `s`:
$$s = \frac{7+t}{r} - 4$$

:::danger 4 June 2024, Section A, Question 18
Make p the subject of the following equation: $5n=\frac{2p}{m}+3$
:::
:::success Answer
$$p = \frac{m(5n-3)}{2}$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `p`.
2.  **Subtract 3 from both sides** to isolate the term containing `p`:
$$5n - 3 = \frac{2p}{m}$$
3.  **Multiply both sides by `m`**:
$$m(5n - 3) = 2p$$
4.  **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for `p`:
$$\frac{m(5n - 3)}{2} = p$$

:::danger 7 March 2024, Section A, Question 16
Make b the subject of the following equation. $a=\frac{2(b+c)}{d}$
:::
:::success Answer
$$b = \frac{ad}{2} - c$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `b`.
2.  **Multiply both sides by `d`**:
$$ad = 2(b+c)$$
3.  **Divide both sides by 2**:
$$\frac{ad}{2} = b+c$$
4.  **Subtract `c` from both sides** to solve for `b`:
$$\frac{ad}{2} - c = b$$

:::danger 12 September 2023, Section A, Question 11
Make x the subject of the following equation: $z(x-y)=3(x-5)$
:::
:::success Answer
$$x = \frac{zy-15}{z-3}$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `x`.
2.  **Expand both brackets:**
$$zx - zy = 3x - 15$$
3.  **Group all `x` terms on one side** and all other terms on the other side:
$$zx - 3x = zy - 15$$
4.  **Factorise `x`** out of the left side:
$$x(z - 3) = zy - 15$$
5.  **Divide by $(z-3)$** to solve for `x`:
$$x = \frac{zy - 15}{z - 3}$$

:::danger 8 March 2022, Section A, Question 15
Make v the subject of the following equation: $t=(uv+3)^{2}$
:::
:::success Answer
$$v = \frac{\sqrt{t}-3}{u}$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Goal:** Isolate the variable `v`.
2.  **Take the square root of both sides** to remove the power:
$$\sqrt{t} = uv+3$$
3.  **Subtract 3 from both sides**:
$$\sqrt{t} - 3 = uv$$
4.  **Divide both sides by `u`** to solve for `v`:
$$\frac{\sqrt{t} - 3}{u} = v$$
