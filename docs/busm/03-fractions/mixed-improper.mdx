## Improper Fractions
### Numerator
The **numerator** is the **top number** in a fraction. It tells you **how many parts of the whole you have**.

In the fraction $$\frac{3}{4}$$, the numerator is **3**.

---
### Denominator
The **denominator** is the **bottom number** in a fraction. It tells you **how many equal parts the whole has been divided into**. The denominator can never be zero.

In the fraction $$\frac{3}{4}$$, the denominator is **4**.

### What is an improper fraction?

An **improper fraction** is a fraction where the **numerator** (the top number) is greater than or equal to the **denominator** (the bottom number). This means the fraction has a value of one whole or more.

### Key Characteristics
* **Numerator ≥ Denominator**: The top number is the same size as or larger than the bottom number.
* **Value ≥ 1**: The fraction represents a quantity equal to or greater than one.
* **Convertible**: Improper fractions can be converted into mixed numbers (a whole number and a proper fraction).

### Example
A classic example of an improper fraction is:
$$\frac{5}{4}$$
This is considered improper because the numerator (5) is larger than the denominator (4). It represents five quarters, which is the same as one whole pizza and one extra slice. As a mixed number, it is written as **$1\frac{1}{4}$**.
