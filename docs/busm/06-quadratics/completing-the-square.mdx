## Completing the Square

**Completing the square** is a method for solving any quadratic equation. It works by converting the side of the equation containing the $x^2$ and $x$ terms into a "perfect square" bracket, which can then be easily solved.

### The Method

1.  **Arrange the Equation:** Ensure the equation is in the format **$x^2 + bx = c$**, with the constant term on the right side.
2.  **Halve the x-coefficient:** Take the coefficient of the x-term (**b**) and divide it by 2.
3.  **Rewrite the Expression:** Replace the $x^2 + bx$ part of the equation with the equivalent expression $(x + \frac{b}{2})^2 - (\frac{b}{2})^2$.
4.  **Isolate the Squared Term:** Move the constant term from the left side to the right side.
5.  **Solve for x:** Take the square root of both sides (remembering the $\pm$ symbol) and solve for x.

### Worked Example

**Problem:** Solve the equation $x^2 + 8x - 5 = 0$ by completing the square.

1.  **Arrange the Equation:**
$$x^2 + 8x = 5$$

2.  **Halve the x-coefficient:**
The coefficient of x is 8. Half of it is **4**.

3.  **Rewrite the Expression:**
Replace $x^2 + 8x$ with $(x+4)^2 - 4^2$. The equation becomes:
$$(x+4)^2 - 16 = 5$$

4.  **Isolate the Squared Term:**
Move the -16 to the right side:
$$(x+4)^2 = 5 + 16$$ $$(x+4)^2 = 21$$

5.  **Solve for x:**
Take the square root of both sides:
$$x + 4 = \pm\sqrt{21}$$   Isolate x for the final answer:
$$x = -4 \pm\sqrt{21}$$

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 19
Solve the following equation by completing the square: $x^{2}-10x=-4$. You may leave your answer in surd form or round your answer to TWO (2) decimal places.
:::
:::success Answer
$x = 9.58$ and $x = 0.42$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Halve the x-coefficient:** Take the coefficient of $x$, which is -10, and divide it by 2: $$\frac{-10}{2} = -5$$
2.  **Rewrite the expression:** Rewrite the left side of the equation in the form $(x+b)^2 - b^2$:
$$(x-5)^2 - 5^2 = -4$$   $$(x-5)^2 - 25 = -4$$
3.  **Isolate the squared term:** Move the constant term (-25) to the right-hand side:
$$(x-5)^2 = -4 + 25$$
4.  **Simplify:**
$$(x-5)^2 = 21$$
5.  **Take the square root:** Take the square root of both sides, remembering to include both positive and negative roots:
$$x - 5 = \pm\sqrt{21}$$
6.  **Solve for x:** Isolate $x$ to find the two possible solutions:
$$x = 5 \pm \sqrt{21}$$
7.  **Calculate the final values:**
$$x \approx 9.58 \text{ and } x \approx 0.42$$
