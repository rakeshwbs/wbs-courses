### What is factorisation?
**Factorising a quadratic expression** is the process of rewriting an expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ as a product of two linear brackets. It is essentially the reverse of expanding brackets.

### The Method (for $x^2 + bx + c$)
The goal is to find **two numbers** that satisfy two conditions:
1.  They must **multiply** to give the constant term (**c**).
2.  They must **add** to give the coefficient of the x-term (**b**).

---
### Worked Example

**Problem:** Factorise the expression $x^2 + 7x + 12$.

1.  **Identify the two numbers:** We need two numbers that multiply to give **+12** and add to give **+7**.
* Factors of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4).
* The pair that adds up to 7 is **3** and **4**.

2.  **Write the factors:** Use these two numbers to form the brackets.
$$(x+3)(x+4)$$

    The factorised form of $x^2 + 7x + 12$ is $(x+3)(x+4)$.

### Solve Quadratic Equation using Factorisation

To solve a quadratic equation by factorising, you find the values of **x** that make the equation true. This method turns the quadratic expression into a product of two brackets that equal zero.

### The Method

1.  **Standard Form:** First, ensure the equation is arranged in the standard form **$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$**.
2.  **Factorise:** Factorise the quadratic expression on the left-hand side into two linear brackets.
3.  **Set Each Factor to Zero:** For the product of the two brackets to be zero, at least one of the brackets must be equal to zero. Set each bracket equal to zero individually.
4.  **Solve for x:** Solve the two resulting simple equations to find the two possible solutions for **x**.

---
### Worked Example

**Problem:** Solve the equation $x^2 + x = 30$ by factorising.

1.  **Standard Form:**
$$x^2 + x - 30 = 0$$
2.  **Factorise:**
We need two numbers that multiply to -30 and add to +1. The numbers are +6 and -5.
$$(x+6)(x-5) = 0$$
3.  **Set Each Factor to Zero:**
Either $(x+6) = 0$ or $(x-5) = 0$.
4.  **Solve for x:**
* If $x+6=0$, then **$x = -6$**.
* If $x-5=0$, then **$x = 5$**.

    The two solutions are **$x = -6$** and **$x = 5$**.
