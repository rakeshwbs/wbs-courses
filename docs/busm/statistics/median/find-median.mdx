The **median** is the middle value in a dataset when the numbers are arranged in order from smallest to largest. The method for finding it depends on whether there is an odd or even number of values.

### **Step 1: Always Order the Data**
Before you can find the median, you **must** arrange the list of numbers in ascending order (from smallest to largest).

---
### **Case I: Odd Number of Values**
When there is an odd number of values in the dataset, the median is the single number that is exactly in the middle.

**Method:**
1.  Order the numbers from smallest to largest.
2.  The median is the value in the middle position.
* You can find the middle position using the formula: $(\frac{n+1}{2})$, where `n` is the count of numbers.

**Example:**

Calculate the median of the following data set: 285, 326, 285, 285, 282, 253, 243, 289, 326.

1.  **Order the data:**
243, 253, 282, 285, **285**, 285, 289, 326, 326
2.  **Find the middle value:** There are 9 numbers, so the middle position is $(\frac{9+1}{2}) = 5^{th}$.
The 5th value in the ordered list is **285**.

The median is **285**.

---
### **Case II: Even Number of Values**
When there is an even number of values, there are two numbers in the middle. The median is the mean (average) of these two middle numbers.

**Method:**
1.  Order the numbers from smallest to largest.
2.  Identify the two middle values.
3.  Add the two middle values together and divide by 2.

**Example:**

Find the median of the following data: 2312, 2893, 3618, 2042, 2704, 3918.

1.  **Order the data:**
2042, 2312, **2704**, **2893**, 3618, 3918
2.  **Find the two middle values:** There are 6 numbers, so the two middle values are the 3rd and 4th numbers: **2704** and **2893**.
3.  **Calculate their mean:**
$$\frac{2704 + 2893}{2} = 2798.5$$

The median is **2798.5**.
