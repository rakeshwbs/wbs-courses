### **Concept: Finding the Median's Class Interval**

When data is presented in a grouped frequency table, you cannot find the exact median value. However, you can determine the **class interval** that contains the median. The median is the middle value in the dataset.

**The Method:**
1.  **Find the Total Frequency (n):** First, add up all the frequencies to find the total number of data points (`n = Σf`).
2.  **Find the Median Position:** The position of the middle value is found by calculating:
$$\text{Median Position} = \frac{n}{2}$$
3.  **Use Cumulative Frequency:** Create a cumulative frequency column. This is a running total of the frequencies.
4.  **Locate the Interval:** Find the first class interval where the cumulative frequency is **greater than or equal to** the median position. This is the interval containing the median.

### **Worked Examples from Past Papers**

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section B, Question 21
The daily commute time for workers is recorded in the table below. State the class interval in which the median length of the commute time lies.

| Commute time, t (minutes) | Frequency |
| :--- | :---: |
| 0 ≤ t < 10 | 6 |
| 10 ≤ t < 25 | 33 |
| 25 ≤ t < 45 | 50 |
| 45 ≤ t < 65 | 72 |
| 65 ≤ t < 90 | 55 |
| 90 ≤ t < 120 | 24 |

:::success Answer
The median lies in the **$45 \le t < 65$** class interval. ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Total Frequency (n):** $6+33+50+72+55+24 = 240$.
2.  **Median Position:** $\frac{240}{2} = 120$. We are looking for the 120th value.
3.  **Cumulative Frequency:**
* $0 \le t < 10$: 6
* $10 \le t < 25$: $6 + 33 = 39$
* $25 \le t < 45$: $39 + 50 = 89$
* $45 \le t < 65$: $89 + 72 = 161$
4.  **Locate the Interval:** The cumulative frequency of 161 is the first to be greater than the median position of 120. Therefore, the median is in this interval.

An airport records the amount of time flights are delayed. State the class interval in which the median time delay lies.

| Amount of delay, t (minutes) | Frequency |
| :--- | :---: |
| 0 ≤ t < 2 | 146 |
| 2 ≤ t < 5 | 96 |
| 5 ≤ t < 10 | 60 |
| 10 ≤ t < 20 | 25 |
| 20 ≤ t < 50 | 45 |
| 50 ≤ t < 90 | 20 |

:::success Answer
The median lies in the **$2 \le t < 5$** class interval. ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Total Frequency (n):** $146+96+60+25+45+20 = 392$.
2.  **Median Position:** $\frac{392}{2} = 196$. We are looking for the 196th value.
3.  **Cumulative Frequency:**
* $0 \le t < 2$: 146
* $2 \le t < 5$: $146 + 96 = 242$
4.  **Locate the Interval:** The cumulative frequency of 242 is the first to be greater than the median position of 196. Therefore, the median is in this interval.

The waiting times of a sample of customers at a branch of a bank are recorded. State the class interval in which the median waiting time lies.

| Waiting times, t (minutes) | Frequency |
| :--- | :---: |
| 0 ≤ t < 2 | 8 |
| 2 ≤ t < 3 | 14 |
| 3 ≤ t < 4 | 17 |
| 4 ≤ t < 6 | 25 |
| 6 ≤ t < 9 | 21 |
| 9 ≤ t < 10 | 7 |

:::success Answer
The median lies in the **$4 \le t < 6$** class interval. ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Total Frequency (n):** $8+14+17+25+21+7 = 92$.
2.  **Median Position:** $\frac{92}{2} = 46$. We are looking for the 46th value.
3.  **Cumulative Frequency:**
* $0 \le t < 2$: 8
* $2 \le t < 3$: $8 + 14 = 22$
* $3 \le t < 4$: $22 + 17 = 39$
* $4 \le t < 6$: $39 + 25 = 64$
4.  **Locate the Interval:** The cumulative frequency of 64 is the first to be greater than the median position of 46. Therefore, the median is in this interval.
