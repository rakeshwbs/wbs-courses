### **Concept: Mean from a Frequency Table** üìä

To find the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, you follow a process similar to finding the mean of a simple list, but it's more efficient for large datasets. Instead of adding each number individually, you multiply each value by how many times it appears (its frequency).

**The Method:**
1.  **Create a new column:** Add a third column to your table labeled **`f √ó x`**, where `f` is the frequency and `x` is the data value.
2.  **Multiply:** For each row, multiply the value (`x`) by its frequency (`f`) and write the result in the new column.
3.  **Find the Totals:** Calculate the sum of the **Frequency (`Œ£f`)** column and the sum of the **`f √ó x` (`Œ£(fx)`)** column.
4.  **Calculate the Mean:** Divide the total of the `f √ó x` column by the total of the `f` column.

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum (f \times x)}{\sum f}$$
