The **mean** is the most common type of average. It is found by adding all the numbers in a dataset together and then dividing by the total count of those numbers.

### The Method

1.  **Sum the Values:** Add up all the numbers in the list to get a total sum.
2.  **Divide by the Count:** Divide that total sum by how many numbers are in the list.

---
### Worked Example

**Problem:** Find the mean of the following data: 2312, 2893, 3618, 2042, 2704, 3918.

1.  **Sum the Values:**
$$2312 + 2893 + 3618 + 2042 + 2704 + 3918 = 17487$$

2.  **Divide by the Count:**
There are **6** numbers in the list.
$$\frac{17487}{6} = 2914.5$$

The mean of this dataset is **2914.5**.
