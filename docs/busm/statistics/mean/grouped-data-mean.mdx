### **Concept: Estimating the Mean from Grouped Data**
---
When data is grouped into class intervals (e.g., "0 ≤ t < 10"), you no longer know the exact value of each data point.

To calculate the mean from this type of table, you must first find an **estimate** for the total of the values in each group.

This is done by making a simple assumption: all values in an interval are evenly distributed and can be represented by the **midpoint** of that interval.

**The Method:**
1.  **Find the Midpoint:** Calculate the midpoint for each class interval.
2.  **Estimate the Total:** For each group, multiply its midpoint by its frequency.
3.  **Calculate the Mean:** Sum the estimated totals from all groups and divide by the total number of data points (the sum of the frequencies).

The formula is:
$$\text{Estimated Mean} = \frac{\sum (f \times m)}{\sum f}$$
* **f** is the frequency of a class.
* **m** is the midpoint of that class.
* **Σ** means "the sum of".
