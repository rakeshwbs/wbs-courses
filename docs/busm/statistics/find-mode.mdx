### **Concept: Finding the Mode**

The **mode** is the value that appears **most frequently** in a list of numbers. It is one of the three main measures of central tendency, alongside the mean and median.

**How to find it:**
1.  **Count the occurrences** of each number in the dataset.
2.  The number with the highest count is the mode.

A dataset can have one mode (**unimodal**), two modes (**bimodal**), or more (**multimodal**). If all numbers appear with the same frequency, there is **no mode**.
