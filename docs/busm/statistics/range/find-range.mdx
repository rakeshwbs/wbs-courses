### **Concept: Finding the Range**

The **range** is the simplest measure of spread or dispersion in a dataset. It tells you the difference between the highest and lowest values in the list.

**How to find it:**
1.  **Identify the Highest Value** in the dataset.
2.  **Identify the Lowest Value** in the dataset.
3.  **Subtract** the lowest value from the highest value.

$$Range = \text{Highest Value} - \text{Lowest Value}$$
