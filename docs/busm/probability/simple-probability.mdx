## Simple Probability (Section A)
---
### **1. Probability from Counts**
These questions ask for the probability of selecting one item at random from a group. The key is to find the total number of items to use as the denominator.

**Rule:**
$$\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of desired outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$$

:::danger 26 November 2019, Section A, Question 7
A box of fruit contains THREE (3) apples and EIGHT (8) oranges. A piece of fruit is selected at random.

State the probability that an orange is selected.
:::
:::success Answer
$$\frac{8}{11}$$ ‚úîÔ∏è
:::note Explanation
1.  **Desired Outcomes:** There are **8** oranges.
2.  **Total Outcomes:** There are a total of $3 + 8 = 11$ pieces of fruit.
3.  **Probability:** The probability is the number of oranges divided by the total number of fruit.

### **2. The 'Not' Rule ‚ùå**
These questions give you the probability of an event happening and ask for the probability of it **not** happening.

**Rule:** The probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability that it does happen.
$$P(\text{not A}) = 1 - P(A)$$

:::danger 27 November 2018, Section A, Question 7
The probability that it will rain on Friday is 0.8. State the probability that it will not rain.
:::
:::success Answer
0.2 ‚úîÔ∏è
:::note Explanation
1.  **Probability of Rain:** $P(\text{rain}) = 0.8$.
2.  **Probability of Not Rain:** The probability that it will not rain is $1 - 0.8 = 0.2$.

---
### **3. The 'And' Rule for Independent Events üîó**
These questions ask for the probability of two separate, unrelated (independent) events both happening.

**Rule:** The probability of two independent events, A and B, both occurring is calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities.
$$P(\text{A and B}) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 5
The probability that Mandy will be late on Monday is 0.05. The probability that Mo will be late on Monday is 0.1.

Calculate the probability that both Mandy and Mo will be late on Monday, assuming that the probabilities are independent. [cite: 32, 33, 34]
:::
:::success Answer
0.005 ‚úîÔ∏è
:::note Explanation
1.  **Identify Probabilities:**
* P(Mandy late) = 0.05
* P(Mo late) = 0.1
2.  **Multiply Probabilities:** Since the events are independent, multiply their probabilities to find the chance of both happening: $0.05 \times 0.1 = 0.005$.
