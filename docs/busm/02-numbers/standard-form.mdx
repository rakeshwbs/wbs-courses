### The Rules of Standard Form

A number is in standard form when it's written as:
$$A \times 10^n$$

There are two main rules for this format:

1.  **The Coefficient (A):** The first number, **A**, must be greater than or equal to 1 but **less than 10** ($1 \le |A| < 10$). This means it can be 1, but it cannot be 10.
2.  **The Exponent (n):** The power of 10, **n**, must be an **integer**, which can be positive, negative, or zero.

### How to Convert to Standard Form

The exponent **n** tells you how many places the decimal point was moved.

* **For Large Numbers (greater than or equal to 10):**
You move the decimal point to the **left** until you have a number between 1 and 10. The number of places you moved the decimal is the **positive** exponent **n**.
  * **Example:** To write **42,000** in standard form:
  * Move the decimal point 4 places to the left: `4.2`
  * The exponent is **+4**.
  * Answer: **$4.2 \times 10^4$**

* **For Small Numbers (less than 1):**
You move the decimal point to the **right** until you have a number between 1 and 10. The number of places you moved the decimal is the **negative** exponent **n**.
  * **Example:** To write **0.0053** in standard form:
  * Move the decimal point 3 places to the right: `5.3`
  * The exponent is **-3**.
  * Answer: **$5.3 \times 10^{-3}$**
