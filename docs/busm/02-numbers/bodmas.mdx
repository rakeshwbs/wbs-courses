<DefinitionBox term="BODMAS">
    BODMAS is a simple acronym that tells you the correct order to solve the different parts of a mathematical equation.
</DefinitionBox>

Following this order is essential to get the correct answer every time.

:::info The acronym stands for:
* **B** - Brackets
* **O** - Orders (Power)
* **D** - Division
* **M** - Multiplication
* **A** - Addition
* **S** - Subtraction
:::
Let's break down each step.

### The Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. B - Brackets ( )
The very first thing you do is solve any calculation that is **inside brackets**. If there are brackets inside other brackets, always start with the innermost set.
* **Example:** In `5 × (4 + 2)`, you solve `4 + 2` first to get 6, then do `5 × 6 = 30`.

#### 2. O - Orders (Powers and Roots)
Next, you deal with any **powers** (like $x^2$ or $x^3$) or **square roots** (like $\sqrt{9}$).
* **Example:** In `3 + 2^2`, you solve the power `2^2` first to get 4, then do `3 + 4 = 7`.

#### 3. D & M - Division (÷ or /) and Multiplication (×)
This is the most important rule to remember: **Division and Multiplication have equal priority.** You don't always do division before multiplication. Instead, you work through the equation from **left to right** and solve any D or M operations as you find them.
* **Example:** In `10 ÷ 2 × 5`, you work from left to right.
  * First do `10 ÷ 2 = 5`.
  * Then do `5 × 5 = 25`.

#### 4. A & S - Addition (+) and Subtraction (-)
Just like Division and Multiplication, **Addition and Subtraction have equal priority.** You work through the equation from **left to right** and solve any A or S operations as you find them.
* **Example:** In `10 - 4 + 3`, you work from left to right.
  * First do `10 - 4 = 6`.
  * Then do `6 + 3 = 9`.

### Worked Example

Let's solve a question from your list using BODMAS: `Calculate: 44 ÷ (2 + 3²)`.

1.  **B (Brackets):** We need to solve what's inside the brackets first: `(2 + 3²)`.
2.  **O (Orders):** Inside the brackets, we have a power. We solve that next: `3² = 9`. The brackets now contain `(2 + 9)`.
3.  **B (Brackets continued):** We finish the calculation inside the brackets: `2 + 9 = 11`.
4.  **D (Division):** The original problem has now been simplified to `44 ÷ 11`. The final answer is **4**.

    By following the BODMAS order, we can solve complex equations accurately. The key is to work step-by-step and not skip ahead.
