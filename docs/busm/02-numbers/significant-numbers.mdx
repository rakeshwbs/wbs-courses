## Significant figures

<DefinitionBox term="Significant Figures">
    <ul>
        <li>In any measurement, significant figures (also known as sig figs or significant digits) are the digits that carry meaning and contribute to its precision.</li>
        <li>This includes all the digits that are known for certain, plus the first digit that is estimated or uncertain.</li>
    </ul>

</DefinitionBox>


### **Rules for Identifying Significant Figures**

1.  **Non-Zero Digits Are Always Significant.**

      Any digit that is not zero is significant.

          * **Example:** The number `345` has **three** significant figures (3, 4, and 5).
          * **Example:** `1.892` has **four** significant figures.

2.  **Zeros Between Non-Zero Digits Are Significant.**

      These are often called "captive zeros."

          * **Example:** `101` has **three** significant figures.
          * **Example:** `50.08` has **four** significant figures.

3.  **Leading Zeros Are Never Significant.**

      Zeros that come before all non-zero digits are placeholders and are not significant.

          * **Example:** `0.05` has only **one** significant figure (the 5).
          * **Example:** `0.00023` has **two** significant figures (the 2 and 3).

4.  **Trailing Zeros (Zeros at the End) Are Sometimes Significant.**

      This rule depends on the presence of a decimal point.

      * Trailing Zeros in a Number with a Decimal Point:

          These are **always significant** as they indicate a specific level of precision.

              * **Example:** `25.00` has **four** significant figures.
              * **Example:** `3.0` has **two** significant figures.

      - Trailing Zeros in a Whole Number without a Decimal Point:

        - These are generally considered **not significant** (ambiguous). They are assumed to be placeholders. To avoid ambiguity, scientific notation is preferred.

              * **Example:** `500` has **one** significant figure (the 5).

                  If it needed to be shown with three significant figures, it would be written as `5.00 x 10²` or `500.` with a decimal point.
