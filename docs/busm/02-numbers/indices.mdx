### Rules of Indices
Here are the complete rules for indices, also known as exponents or powers.

### **1. Multiplication Rule**
When multiplying powers with the **same base**, you **add** the exponents.
* **Rule:** $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
* **Example:** $x^4 \times x^3 = x^{4+3} = x^7$

---
### **2. Division Rule**
When dividing powers with the **same base**, you **subtract** the exponents.
* **Rule:** $ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$
* **Example:** $ \frac{y^8}{ y^5}  = y^{8-5} = y^3$

---
### **3. Power of a Power Rule**
When raising a power to another power, you **multiply** the exponents.
* **Rule:** $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
* **Example:** $(b^3)^5 = b^{3 \times 5} = b^{15}$

---
### **4. Power of a Product Rule**
A power outside of a bracket applies to every term inside the bracket.
* **Rule:** $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$
* **Example:** $(2x)^4 = 2^4 x^4 = 16x^4$

---
### **5. Zero Exponent Rule**
Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is equal to **1**.
* **Rule:** $a^0 = 1$ (where $a \neq 0$)
* **Example:** $7^0 = 1$

---
### **6. Negative Exponent Rule**
A negative exponent indicates the **reciprocal** of the base raised to the positive exponent.
* **Rule:** $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$
* **Example:** $x^{-5} = \frac{1}{x^5}$

---
### **7. Fractional Exponent Rule (Roots)**
A fractional exponent indicates a root. The denominator of the fraction is the type of root.
* **Rule:** $a^{m/n} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m$
* **Example (unit fraction):** $64^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4$
* **Example (general fraction):** $9^{3/2} = (\sqrt[2]{9})^3 = 3^3 = 27$

:::danger 19th November 2024, Section A, Question 6
Simplify: $m^{3}\times m^{4}\div m^{9}$
:::
:::success Answer
$m^{-2}$ or $$\frac{1}{m^2}$$ ✔️
:::note Explanation
1.  **Multiplication:** First, apply the multiplication rule ($m^a \times m^b = m^{a+b}$) to get $m^{3+4} = m^7$.
2.  **Division:** The expression becomes $m^7 \div m^9$. Using the division rule, this is written as $$\frac{m^7}{m^9} = m^{7-9} = m^{-2}$$.
