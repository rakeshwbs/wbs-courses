        question:
            "Which type of OSPF LSA is generated by an Area Border Router (ABR) to advertise routes from one area into another?",
        options: [
            "Type 1 (Router LSA)",
            "Type 2 (Network LSA)",
            "Type 3 (Summary LSA)",
            "Type 5 (External LSA)"
        ],
        answer: "Type 3 (Summary LSA)",
        explanation:
            "An ABR takes the detailed information from Type 1 and 2 LSAs within an area and 'summarizes' it into a Type 3 LSA, which is then flooded into adjacent areas. This is how inter-area routing is achieved."
    },
    {
        question:
            "What is the primary function of configuring an OSPF area as a 'stub area'?",
        options: [
            "To increase the cost of all links within the area.",
            "To block external routes (Type 5 LSAs) from entering the area, thus reducing the LSDB size.",
            "To automatically summarize all routes within the area.",
            "To disable the DR/BDR election process."
        ],
        answer: "To block external routes (Type 5 LSAs) from entering the area, thus reducing the LSDB size.",
        explanation:
            "The main purpose of a stub area is to reduce router resource consumption. It does this by preventing detailed external routes from being flooded into the area and replacing them with a single default route."
    },
    {
        question:
            "In an OSPF routing table, what does the code 'O IA' signify?",
        options: [
            "An OSPF route that is currently inactive.",
            "An OSPF route learned from an ASBR.",
            "An OSPF route that is internal to the local area.",
            "An OSPF route that originated in a different area (Inter-Area)."
        ],
        answer: "An OSPF route that originated in a different area (Inter-Area).",
        explanation:
            "The 'O' stands for OSPF, and 'IA' stands for Inter-Area. This code indicates a route that was learned via a Type 3 Summary LSA from an ABR."
    },
    {
        question:
            "On which type of router is inter-area route summarization configured?",
        options: [
            "On any internal router within the area.",
            "On the Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR).",
            "On the Area Border Router (ABR).",
            "On the Designated Router (DR)."
        ],
        answer: "On the Area Border Router (ABR).",
        explanation:
            "Summarization between areas is configured on the ABR using the `area [id] range [address] [mask]` command, as the ABR is the gateway between areas and controls what information passes through."
    },
    {
        question:
            "What is an Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR)?",
        options: [
            "A router that connects two OSPF areas together.",
            "The router with the highest Router ID in the network.",
            "A router that injects routes learned from a different routing protocol (like BGP) into the OSPF domain.",
            "A router that belongs to a stub area."
        ],
        answer: "A router that injects routes learned from a different routing protocol (like BGP) into the OSPF domain.",
        explanation:
            "An ASBR acts as the gateway between the OSPF autonomous system and an external network. It's responsible for redistribution and generating Type 5 LSAs."
    },
    {
        question:
            "Which special OSPF area type allows an ASBR to exist within it while still blocking Type 5 LSAs from the backbone?",
        options: [
            "Stub Area",
            "Totally Stubby Area",
            "Backbone Area",
            "Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)"
        ],
        answer: "Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)",
        explanation:
            "NSSA is a hybrid area that blocks external routes from other areas but allows its own ASBR to inject external routes using a special Type 7 LSA."
    },
    {
        question:
            "What is the primary purpose of an OSPF Virtual Link?",
        options: [
            "To increase the bandwidth between two routers.",
            "To provide a backup physical connection.",
            "To connect an area to the backbone Area 0 through a non-backbone transit area.",
            "To encrypt OSPF routing updates."
        ],
        answer: "To connect an area to the backbone Area 0 through a non-backbone transit area.",
        explanation:
            "A virtual link is a 'band-aid' used to fix a broken OSPF design where an area is physically disconnected from Area 0. It creates a logical tunnel to satisfy the OSPF requirement."
    },
    {
        question:
            "Which of the following LSA types are flooded throughout the entire OSPF Autonomous System (by default)?",
        options: [
            "Type 1 (Router LSA) and Type 2 (Network LSA)",
            "Type 5 (AS External LSA)",
            "Type 3 (Summary LSA) only",
            "All LSA types are flooded everywhere."
        ],
        answer: "Type 5 (AS External LSA)",
        explanation:
            "Type 1 and 2 LSAs are confined to their local area. Type 3 LSAs are used to cross area boundaries. Type 5 LSAs, which represent external routes, are flooded to all standard areas in the AS."
    },
    {
        question:
            "A 'Totally Stubby Area' is even more restrictive than a standard Stub Area. What additional LSA type does it block?",
        options: [
            "Type 1 (Router LSA)",
            "Type 3 (Summary LSA)",
            "Type 7 (NSSA LSA)",
            "It does not block any additional LSAs."
        ],
        answer: "Type 3 (Summary LSA)",
        explanation:
            "A Totally Stubby Area blocks both external routes (Type 5) and inter-area routes (Type 3). A router inside a totally stubby area only knows about routes within its area and a single default route for everything else."
    },
    {
        question:
            "What command is used on a Cisco router to inspect the list of all LSAs that make up the OSPF topological map?",
        options: [
            "show ip route ospf",
            "show ip ospf interface",
            "show ip ospf neighbor",
            "show ip ospf database"
        ],
        answer: "show ip ospf database",
        explanation:
            "The `show ip ospf database` command displays a summary of the Link-State Database (LSDB), allowing you to see all the individual LSAs the router has learned."
