        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a research design?",
        "options": [
            "To provide a master plan or blueprint for conducting the study.",
            "To formulate the null hypothesis.",
            "To guarantee the research will be published.",
            "To select the statistical software for analysis."
        ],
        "answer": "To provide a master plan or blueprint for conducting the study.",
        "explanation": "The research design is the overall strategy that a researcher chooses to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way, thereby ensuring that the research problem is effectively addressed."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is the single most important feature that distinguishes a 'true experimental design' from a 'quasi-experimental design'?",
        "options": [
            "The use of a control group.",
            "The manipulation of an independent variable.",
            "The random assignment of participants to groups.",
            "The measurement of a dependent variable."
        ],
        "answer": "The random assignment of participants to groups.",
        "explanation": "While both designs manipulate an independent variable, only a true experimental design uses random assignment. This is the key feature that minimizes bias and allows for strong causal claims."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher finds a strong positive relationship between daily coffee consumption and job productivity. What can the researcher conclude?",
        "options": [
            "Drinking coffee definitely causes higher productivity.",
            "Higher productivity causes people to drink more coffee.",
            "Coffee consumption and productivity are related, but one does not necessarily cause the other.",
            "The research design was a true experiment."
        ],
        "answer": "Coffee consumption and productivity are related, but one does not necessarily cause the other.",
        "explanation": "This is a classic example of correlation not implying causation. A third variable (e.g., longer working hours) could be causing an increase in both coffee consumption and productivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which research design is best suited for establishing a definitive cause-and-effect relationship?",
        "options": [
            "Survey Research",
            "Case Study",
            "True Experimental Design",
            "Correlational Research"
        ],
        "answer": "True Experimental Design",
        "explanation": "With its manipulation of the IV, use of a control group, and random assignment, the true experimental design is the gold standard for determining causality."
    },
    {
        "question": "A study that investigates the political opinions of a country's population by sending out a questionnaire to 2,000 people is an example of...?",
        "options": [
            "A case study",
            "A true experiment",
            "A quasi-experiment",
            "Survey research"
        ],
        "answer": "Survey research",
        "explanation": "Survey research specializes in gathering data on the attitudes, opinions, and behaviors of a sample, typically through questionnaires or interviews, to describe a larger population."
    },
    {
        "question": "A key drawback of the 'case study' research design is that its findings...",
        "options": [
            "Are always incorrect.",
            "Are not generalizable to a wider population.",
            "Are too expensive to conduct.",
            "Cannot establish correlation."
        ],
        "answer": "Are not generalizable to a wider population.",
        "explanation": "Because a case study focuses in-depth on a single individual, group, or event, its detailed findings cannot be reliably applied to other situations or people."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher wants to study the effect of a new traffic law in a city. They measure accident rates before and after the law is implemented and compare them to a neighboring city that did not implement the law. This is an example of what design?",
        "options": [
            "True Experimental Design",
            "Quasi-Experimental Design",
            "Correlational Research",
            "Case Study"
        ],
        "answer": "Quasi-Experimental Design",
        "explanation": "The researcher is manipulating an IV (the new law) but cannot randomly assign citizens to live in one city or the other. The lack of random assignment makes this a quasi-experiment."
    },
    {
        "question": "In a non-experimental design, the researcher's role is best described as a(n)...?",
        "options": [
            "Active manipulator",
            "Passive observer and measurer",
            "Participant in the control group",
            "Creator of the independent variable"
        ],
        "answer": "Passive observer and measurer",
        "explanation": "In non-experimental designs like surveys or correlational studies, the researcher measures variables as they naturally occur without intervening or manipulating them."
    },
    {
        "question": "When trying to open an Excel file in SPSS using 'File > Open > Data...', what is a critical step in the dialog box?",
        "options": [
            "Checking the 'Read variable names from the first row of data' box.",
            "Changing the 'Files of type:' dropdown to 'Excel'.",
            "Renaming the file on the spot.",
            "Typing a password."
        ],
        "answer": "Changing the 'Files of type:' dropdown to 'Excel'.",
        "explanation": "By default, SPSS looks for its own file type (*.sav). You must change the 'Files of type' dropdown to 'Excel' for your spreadsheet file to become visible and selectable."
    },
    {
        "question": "If a research question asks 'Is X related to Y?', which design is most appropriate?",
        "options": [
            "Correlational research",
            "Case study",
            "True experiment",
            "Quasi-experiment"
        ],
        "answer": "Correlational research",
        "explanation": "Correlational research is specifically designed to measure and describe the relationship or association between two or more variables as they naturally exist."
