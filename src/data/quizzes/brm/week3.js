    {
        "question": "What is the primary characteristic of a Null Hypothesis (H₀)?",
        "options": [
            "It is the researcher's prediction of an outcome.",
            "It is a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'.",
            "It specifies the direction of a relationship.",
            "It can only be used in qualitative research."
        ],
        "answer": "It is a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'.",
        "explanation": "The Null Hypothesis always posits that there is no relationship between variables or no difference between groups, and any observed effect is due to random chance. Research aims to gather evidence to reject it."
    },
    {
        "question": "The statement: 'Employees who receive a bonus will have HIGHER job satisfaction than those who do not' is an example of what?",
        "options": [
            "A non-directional hypothesis",
            "A null hypothesis",
            "A directional hypothesis",
            "A research problem"
        ],
        "answer": "A directional hypothesis",
        "explanation": "This is a directional alternative hypothesis because it specifies the exact direction of the expected outcome by using the word 'higher'."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is the most compelling reason to screen your data before analysis?",
        "options": [
            "To make the dataset look bigger.",
            "To formulate the null hypothesis.",
            "To identify and correct potential data entry errors or outliers.",
            "To choose the colors for your 10-graphs."
        ],
        "answer": "To identify and correct potential data entry errors or outliers.",
        "explanation": "Data screening is a critical first step to ensure data quality. Errors like typos (e.g., age=999) can severely distort the results of any statistical analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "A manager says, 'Our employee turnover has increased by 30%.' What does this statement represent in the hierarchy of research questions?",
        "options": [
            "A testable hypothesis",
            "An alternative hypothesis",
            "A management problem",
            "A specific research question"
        ],
        "answer": "A management problem",
        "explanation": "This is a broad, practical issue or symptom facing the organization. The next step would be to translate this into a more focused research problem to investigate its causes."
    },
    {
        "question": "The 'F' in the FINER criteria for evaluating a research question stands for...?",
        "options": [
            "Falsifiable",
            "Factual",
            "Fundamental",
            "Feasible"
        ],
        "answer": "Feasible",
        "explanation": "The 'F' in FINER stands for Feasible, which means you must have the necessary resources, time, and expertise to actually conduct the study."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a NON-directional hypothesis?",
        "options": [
            "Increased study time leads to higher test scores.",
            "There is no relationship between diet and energy levels.",
            "A new drug will reduce recovery time.",
            "There is a significant association between a user's age and their social media platform preference."
        ],
        "answer": "There is a significant association between a user's age and their social media platform preference.",
        "explanation": "This is non-directional because it predicts a relationship exists but does not specify the nature of that relationship (e.g., whether older users prefer one platform over another)."
    },
    {
        "question": "A key characteristic of a good scientific hypothesis is that it must be 'falsifiable'. What does this mean?",
        "options": [
            "It must be false.",
            "It must be possible to collect evidence that could prove it wrong.",
            "It must be written in a complex way.",
            "It must be a well-known fact."
        ],
        "answer": "It must be possible to collect evidence that could prove it wrong.",
        "explanation": "Falsifiability is a cornerstone of the scientific method. If a statement cannot be tested and potentially proven false, it is not a scientific hypothesis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Consider the hypothesis: 'A higher price for a product leads to a lower quantity of sales.' What is the dependent variable (DV)?",
        "options": [
            "The price of the product",
            "The quality of the product",
            "The quantity of sales",
            "The type of customer"
        ],
        "answer": "The quantity of sales",
        "explanation": "The quantity of sales is the Dependent Variable because it is the 'effect' that is being measured and is expected to depend on the price (the IV)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the primary role of the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)?",
        "options": [
            "To state that there is no effect.",
            "To be the statement the researcher typically believes is true.",
            "To ensure the data is clean.",
            "To act as a control in the experiment."
        ],
        "answer": "To be the statement the researcher typically believes is true.",
        "explanation": "The Alternative Hypothesis represents the researcher's actual prediction or the theory they are trying to support with evidence."
    },
    {
        "question": "When screening data in SPSS, which is the most efficient way to check for impossible values (e.g., a score of 110 on a test out of 100)?",
        "options": [
            "Manually read every single cell in the Data View.",
            "Create a bar chart.",
            "Run the 'Frequencies' or 'Descriptives' command and check the Minimum and Maximum values in the output.",
            "Sort the data alphabetically."
        ],
        "answer": "Run the 'Frequencies' or 'Descriptives' command and check the Minimum and Maximum values in the output.",
        "explanation": "Checking the minimum and maximum values in a descriptive statistics table is the fastest way to spot values that fall outside the possible range, indicating a data entry error."
    }
