        "question": "In sampling, what is the term for the entire group of individuals that a researcher wants to draw conclusions about?",
        "options": [
            "The Sample",
            "The Population",
            "The Cluster",
            "The Quota"
        ],
        "answer": "The Population",
        "explanation": "The population is the complete set of individuals or items that share at least one property in common that is the subject of a statistical analysis."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which type of sampling gives every member of the population a known, non-zero chance of being selected?",
        "options": [
            "Quota Sampling",
            "Convenience Sampling",
            "Probability Sampling",
            "Purposive Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Probability Sampling",
        "explanation": "This is the defining characteristic of probability sampling. It reduces bias and is essential for generalizing results to the broader population."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher surveys students entering the university library on a Monday morning. What type of sampling is this?",
        "options": [
            "Simple Random Sampling",
            "Stratified Sampling",
            "Convenience Sampling",
            "Systematic Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Convenience Sampling",
        "explanation": "This is convenience sampling because the researcher is selecting participants who are the easiest to access, which may not be representative of the entire student population."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher divides a company's employees into departments (e.g., Sales, HR, IT) and then takes a simple random sample from within each department. This is an example of...?",
        "options": [
            "Cluster Sampling",
            "Stratified Sampling",
            "Simple Random Sampling",
            "Snowball Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Stratified Sampling",
        "explanation": "Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into relevant subgroups (strata) to ensure that each group is adequately represented in the final sample."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which sampling method is most useful for reaching hidden or hard-to-find populations?",
        "options": [
            "Quota Sampling",
            "Systematic Sampling",
            "Simple Random Sampling",
            "Snowball Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Snowball Sampling",
        "explanation": "Snowball sampling relies on referrals from initial subjects to generate additional subjects, which is ideal for when members of a population are difficult to locate."
    },
    {
        "question": "In SPSS, what is the primary function of the 'Compute Variable' command?",
        "options": [
            "To perform calculations on existing variables to create a new variable.",
            "To sort the data file alphabetically.",
            "To change the font size of the data.",
            "To regroup existing categories of a variable."
        ],
        "answer": "To perform calculations on existing variables to create a new variable.",
        "explanation": "The Compute Variable command is used for data transformations involving mathematical formulas, such as adding or averaging several items to create a total score."
    },
    {
        "question": "The main advantage of probability sampling over non-probability sampling is that it...",
        "options": [
            "Is always cheaper and faster.",
            "Requires a smaller sample size.",
            "Allows for the generalization of findings to the population.",
            "Is easier to perform."
        ],
        "answer": "Allows for the generalization of findings to the population.",
        "explanation": "Because probability samples are more representative, the results from the sample can be more confidently inferred to apply to the entire population from which it was drawn."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher selects every 20th name from a list of company employees. This technique is called...?",
        "options": [
            "Simple Random Sampling",
            "Systematic Sampling",
            "Cluster Sampling",
            "Convenience Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Systematic Sampling",
        "explanation": "Systematic sampling involves selecting items from an ordered sampling frame at a regular, fixed interval, known as the sampling interval."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Recode into Different Variables' command in SPSS?",
        "options": [
            "To calculate the average of several variables.",
            "To group a continuous variable (like age) into a categorical variable (like age groups).",
            "To run a reliability analysis.",
            "To import data from Excel."
        ],
        "answer": "To group a continuous variable (like age) into a categorical variable (like age groups).",
        "explanation": "Recoding is used to change or combine the values of a variable. A common use is to collapse a continuous variable into a smaller number of ordered categories."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher wants to interview experts in the field of artificial intelligence. They hand-pick 15 of the most published authors in the field. This is an example of...?",
        "options": [
            "Simple Random Sampling",
            "Purposive Sampling",
            "Convenience Sampling",
            "Cluster Sampling"
        ],
        "answer": "Purposive Sampling",
        "explanation": "Purposive (or judgmental) sampling is where the researcher uses their own judgment to select participants who they believe will provide the most valuable information for the study."
