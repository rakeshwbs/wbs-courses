        "question": "What is the primary goal of business research?",
        "options": [
            "To find interesting facts about a company's history.",
            "To provide data for evidence-based decision making.",
            "To prove a manager's pre-existing personal opinion.",
            "To replace the need for all business experience."
        ],
        "answer": "To provide data for evidence-based decision making.",
        "explanation": "The core purpose of business research is to reduce uncertainty and support decisions with objective data, rather than relying solely on intuition, opinion, or random facts."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the formal research process, what is the immediate step after identifying the problem or opportunity?",
        "options": [
            "Collect the data",
            "Analyze the data",
            "Review existing literature",
            "Report the findings"
        ],
        "answer": "Review existing literature",
        "explanation": "Before designing a new study, a researcher must understand what is already known about the topic. This prevents 'reinventing the wheel' and helps to refine the research question."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of QUALITATIVE research?",
        "options": [
            "Using large sample sizes for generalizability.",
            "A primary focus on numerical data and statistical analysis.",
            "Exploring 'Why?' or 'How?' questions for in-depth understanding.",
            "Testing a specific hypothesis using 02-numbers."
        ],
        "answer": "Exploring 'Why?' or 'How?' questions for in-depth understanding.",
        "explanation": "Qualitative research excels at exploring topics in-depth to understand underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations, often using non-numerical data like interview transcripts."
    },
    {
        "question": "A specific, testable prediction about the relationship between two or more variables is known as a(n)...?",
        "options": [
            "Theory",
            "Problem statement",
            "Hypothesis",
            "Research summary"
        ],
        "answer": "Hypothesis",
        "explanation": "A hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ) is a precise, falsifiable statement that can be empirically tested. A theory is a broader explanation, and a problem statement is a more general declaration of an issue."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher starts with an established theory, forms a specific prediction from it, and then collects data to see if the prediction is supported. This 'top-down' approach is known as...?",
        "options": [
            "Inductive reasoning",
            "Qualitative analysis",
            "Deductive reasoning",
            "Problem discovery"
        ],
        "answer": "Deductive reasoning",
        "explanation": "Deductive reasoning moves from a general theory to a specific, testable hypothesis. It is the classic approach used in quantitative, hypothesis-testing research."
    },
    {
        "question": "A study conducted by a pharmaceutical company to determine the most effective advertising campaign for a new drug is a clear example of...?",
        "options": [
            "Basic research",
            "Theoretical research",
            "Applied research",
            "Philosophical research"
        ],
        "answer": "Applied research",
        "explanation": "Applied research is undertaken to solve a specific, practical, real-world problem for an organization, as opposed to basic research which aims to expand general scientific knowledge."
    },
    {
        "question": "In the context of research, what is the main role of a theory?",
        "options": [
            "To act as a final, unchangeable truth.",
            "To provide a conceptual map for developing testable hypotheses.",
            "To eliminate the need for any data collection.",
            "To serve as the final report for stakeholders."
        ],
        "answer": "To provide a conceptual map for developing testable hypotheses.",
        "explanation": "A theory guides the research by suggesting which variables are important and how they might relate, providing a foundation upon which specific hypotheses can be built and tested."
    },
    {
        "question": "A research method that relies on collecting numerical data and performing statistical analysis is called...?",
        "options": [
            "Qualitative research",
            "Quantitative research",
            "Historical research",
            "Ethnographic research"
        ],
        "answer": "Quantitative research",
        "explanation": "The term 'quantitative' directly relates to quantity. This approach is defined by its use of 02-numbers, measurements, and statistical techniques to analyze data."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher conducts detailed interviews with 15 disgruntled employees to understand the reasons for low morale. This 'bottom-up' approach, aiming to build a theory from the data, is known as...?",
        "options": [
            "Deductive reasoning",
            "Experimental research",
            "Inductive reasoning",
            "Statistical analysis"
        ],
        "answer": "Inductive reasoning",
        "explanation": "Inductive reasoning builds a general theory or conclusion from specific observations or data. It moves from the specific (interview data) to the general (a theory about morale)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is typically the final step in the formal research process?",
        "options": [
