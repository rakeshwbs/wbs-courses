            "Experimental Data",
            "Secondary Data"
        ],
        "answer": "Secondary Data",
        "explanation": "Secondary data is data that was collected by someone else for a different purpose. Government census data is a classic example."

        "question": "Which data collection method is best suited for gaining a deep, personal understanding of an individual's experiences and perspectives?",
        "options": [
            "A structured survey",
            "A true experiment",
            "An in-depth interview",
            "A structured observation"
        ],
        "answer": "An in-depth interview",
        "explanation": "In-depth interviews are a qualitative method designed to explore topics in rich detail with a single person, allowing for probing follow-up questions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the key feature that distinguishes a focus group from a series of one-on-one interviews?",
        "options": [
            "The use of a moderator.",
            "The questions are open-ended.",
            "The data collected is qualitative.",
            "The interaction between participants is part of the data."
        ],
        "answer": "The interaction between participants is part of the data.",
        "explanation": "In a focus group, the dynamic conversation and discussion among participants often reveal insights that would not emerge in individual interviews."
    },
    {
        "question": "In survey research, what is the primary purpose of a 'codebook'?",
        "options": [
            "To write the survey questions.",
            "To act as a guide for translating survey responses into numerical data for analysis.",
            "To keep a list of participant names and addresses.",
            "To perform the final statistical analysis."
        ],
        "answer": "To act as a guide for translating survey responses into numerical data for analysis.",
        "explanation": "A codebook is a crucial document that specifies how to convert categorical answers (e.g., 'Agree', 'Disagree') into 02-numbers (e.g., 4, 2) that can be entered into SPSS."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher sits in a coffee shop and counts how many customers purchase a pastry with their coffee. This is an example of...?",
        "options": [
            "A focus group",
            "An in-depth interview",
            "A survey",
            "A structured observation"
        ],
        "answer": "A structured observation",
        "explanation": "This is a structured observation because the researcher is systematically counting specific, pre-defined behaviors in a natural setting without interacting with the subjects."
    },
    {
        "question": "Which of the following is a significant advantage of using Primary Data?",
        "options": [
            "It is always cheaper and faster to obtain than secondary data.",
            "It is perfectly tailored to your specific research question.",
            "It is free from any potential bias.",
            "It is always quantitative."
        ],
        "answer": "It is perfectly tailored to your specific research question.",
        "explanation": "Because you design the collection method yourself, primary data directly addresses the variables and constructs you are interested in, which may not be true for secondary data."
    },
    {
        "question": "Surveys that primarily use multiple-choice and rating-scale questions are a form of what type of data collection?",
        "options": [
            "Qualitative",
            "Ethnographic",
            "Quantitative",
            "Historical"
        ],
        "answer": "Quantitative",
        "explanation": "These closed-ended questions generate numerical data that can be counted, measured, and analyzed statistically, which is the hallmark of quantitative methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "A potential disadvantage of the focus group method is that...",
        "options": [
            "It is too expensive for most researchers.",
            "The discussion can be dominated by one or two vocal individuals.",
            "It generates numerical data that is hard to analyze.",
            "It can only be done online."
        ],
        "answer": "The discussion can be dominated by one or two vocal individuals.",
        "explanation": "A skilled moderator is needed to manage the group dynamic and ensure that all participants have a chance to share their views, preventing a few people from skewing the results."
    },
    {
        "question": "Toggling on 'Value Labels' in the SPSS Data View is useful for what purpose?",

            "To calculate the mean of the variable."
        ],
        "answer": "To confirm that your numeric codes (e.g., '1') correctly correspond to their text labels (e.g., 'Male').",
