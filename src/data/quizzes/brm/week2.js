    {
        "question": "Which term refers to a specific, measurable representation of a concept that can take on different values?",
        "options": [
            "A theory",
            "A construct",
            "A variable",
            "A conceptual definition"
        ],
        "answer": "A variable",
        "explanation": "A variable is the empirical, measurable form of a concept or construct used in research. For example, the concept of 'intelligence' is measured using the variable 'IQ Score'."
    },
    {
        "question": "The definition of 'customer loyalty' as 'the number of times a customer purchases a specific brand in a year' is an example of what?",
        "options": [
            "An operational definition",
            "A conceptual definition",
            "A theoretical framework",
            "A qualitative concept"
        ],
        "answer": "An operational definition",
        "explanation": "This definition is operational because it specifies the exact procedure or 'operation' (counting purchases) used to measure the abstract concept of customer loyalty."
    },
    {
        "question": "In a study testing if a new training program improves employee performance, what is the 'training program'?",
        "options": [
            "The dependent variable",
            "The independent variable",
            "The mediating variable",
            "The control variable"
        ],
        "answer": "The independent variable",
        "explanation": "The training program is the Independent Variable (IV) because it is the factor that is being introduced or manipulated by the researcher to see if it causes a change in employee performance (the DV)."
    },
    {
        "question": "A researcher finds that the relationship between hours spent studying (IV) and exam scores (DV) is much stronger for students who get adequate sleep. In this case, 'adequate sleep' is a...?",
        "options": [
            "Dependent variable",
            "Mediating variable",
            "Independent variable",
            "Moderating variable"
        ],
        "answer": "Moderating variable",
        "explanation": "Sleep is a Moderating Variable because it changes the strength of the relationship between studying and scores. It acts like a volume knob on the main effect."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the key difference between a concept and a construct?",
        "options": [
            "A concept is measurable, but a construct is not.",
            "A construct is a more abstract, deliberately invented concept for a specific research purpose.",
            "A concept is only used in qualitative research, while a construct is only used in quantitative.",
            "There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable."
        ],
        "answer": "A construct is a more abstract, deliberately invented concept for a specific research purpose.",
        "explanation": "While related, a construct (e.g., 'brand equity') is a higher-level abstraction consciously created by researchers, often combining multiple simpler concepts."
    },
    {
        "question": "The variable 'employee performance' is the presumed 'effect' that is measured in a study. What type of variable is it?",
        "options": [
            "The dependent variable",
            "The independent variable",
            "The moderating variable",
            "The control variable"
        ],
        "answer": "The dependent variable",
        "explanation": "The Dependent Variable (DV) is the outcome variable that is measured to assess the effect of the independent variable. Its value 'depends' on the IV."
    },
    {
        "question": "A study suggests that a positive work environment (IV) leads to higher job satisfaction (MeV), which in turn leads to lower employee turnover (DV). What role does 'job satisfaction' play?",
        "options": [
            "Control variable",
            "Independent variable",
            "Moderating variable",
            "Mediating variable"
        ],
        "answer": "Mediating variable",
        "explanation": "Job satisfaction is the Mediating Variable because it explains the 'how' or 'why' mechanism through which the work environment affects turnover. It's the intermediate step in the causal chain."
    },
    {
        "question": "The 'dictionary definition' of a term, which explains it in abstract words, is known as its...?",
        "options": [
            "Variable definition",
            "Operational definition",
            "Conceptual definition",
            "Data definition"
        ],
        "answer": "Conceptual definition",
        "explanation": "A conceptual definition defines a concept in theoretical terms, explaining what it is, as opposed to an operational definition, which explains how to measure it."
    },
    {
        "question": "In SPSS, what level of 'Measure' would be most appropriate for the variable 'Education Level' with categories 'High School', 'Bachelor\\'s', 'Master\\'s', 'PhD'?",
        "options": [
            "Scale",
            "Nominal",
            "Ordinal",
            "String"
        ],
        "answer": "Ordinal",
        "explanation": "This data is Ordinal because there is a clear, meaningful order to the categories, but the 'distance' between High School and Bachelor's is not necessarily the same as between Master's and PhD."
    },
    {
        "question": "In SPSS, what level of 'Measure' would be most appropriate for the variable 'Country of Birth'?",
        "options": [
            "Scale",
            "Ordinal",
            "Nominal",
            "Interval"
        ],
        "answer": "Nominal",
        "explanation": "This data is Nominal because the categories (e.g., USA, Canada, India) have no inherent order or rank. One country is not 'higher' or 'lower' than another in this context."
